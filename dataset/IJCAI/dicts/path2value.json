Starting with Li’s strengthening of strategyproofness, obvious strategyproofness (OSP) requires truthtelling to be \"obvious\" over dishonesty, roughly meaning that the worst outcome from truthful actions must be no worse than the best outcome for dishonest ones. A celebrated result for dominant-strategy incentive-compatible mechanisms that allows us to restrict attention to direct mechanisms, known as the revelation principle, does not hold for OSP: the implementation details matter for the obvious incentive properties of the mechanism. Studying agent strategies in real-life mechanisms, Troyan and Morrill introduce a relaxation of strategyproofness known as non-obvious manipulability, which only requires comparing certain extrema of the agents’ utility functions in order for a mechanism to be incentive-compatible. Specifically a mechanism is not obviously manipulable (NOM) if the best and worst outcomes when acting truthfully are no worse than the best and worst outcomes when acting dishonestly. In this work we first extend the cycle monotonicity framework for direct-revelation NOM mechanism design to indirect mechanisms. We then apply this to two settings, single-parameter agents and mechanisms for two agents in which one has a two-value domain, and show that under these models the revelation principle holds: direct mechanisms are just as powerful as indirect ones.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>58>>title": "HireVAE: An Online and Adaptive Factor Model Based on Hierarchical and Regime-Switch VAE", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>58>>abstract": "Factor model is a fundamental investment tool in quantitative investment, which can be empowered by deep learning to become more flexible and efficient in practical complicated investing situations.

To tackle this problem, we propose the first deep learning based online and adaptive factor model, HireVAE, at the core of which is a hierarchical latent space that embeds the underlying relationship between the market situation and stock-wise latent factors, so that HireVAE can effectively estimate useful latent factors given only historical market information and subsequently predict accurate stock returns.

We thoroughly analyze the distribution mismatch between the benign and adversarial samples. This distribution mismatch and the mutual learning mechanism with the same learning ratio applied in prior art defense strategies is the main cause leading the accuracy degradation for benign samples. The proposed AdvAmd is demonstrated to steadily heal the accuracy degradation and even leads to a certain accuracy boost of common neural models on benign classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. The efficacy of the AdvAmd is contributed by three key components: mediate samples (to reduce the influence of distribution mismatch with a fine-grained amendment), auxiliary batch norm (to solve the mutual learning mechanism and the smoother judgment surface), and AdvAmd loss (to adjust the learning ratios according to different attack vulnerabilities) through quantitative and ablation experiments.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>86>>title": "TPS++: Attention-Enhanced Thin-Plate Spline for Scene Text Recognition", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>86>>abstract": "Text irregularities pose significant challenges to scene text recognizers.

In this work, we introduce TPS++, an attention-enhanced TPS transformation that incorporates the attention mechanism to text rectification for the first time. TPS++ formulates the parameter calculation as a joint process of foreground control point regression and content-based attention score estimation, which is computed by a dedicated designed gated-attention block. TPS++ builds a more flexible content-aware rectifier, generating a natural text correction that is easier to read by the subsequent recognizer. Moreover, TPS++ shares the feature backbone with the recognizer in part and implements the rectification at feature-level rather than image-level, incurring only a small overhead in terms of parameters and inference time.

In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Graph Disentangled Networks for review-based recommendation (SGDN), to separately model the user-item interactions based on the latent factors through the textual review data. To this end, we first model the distributions of interactions over latent factors from both semantic information in review data and structural information in user-item graph data, forming several factor graphs.

To address this issue,  we first propose a novel information theoretical measure: kernelized Rényi’s entropy, by utilizing operator representation in Hilbert space. It inherits the properties of Shannon’s entropy and can be effectively calculated via simple random sampling, while remaining independent of the input dimension. We then establish the generalization error bounds for SGD/SGLD under kernelized Rényi’s entropy, where the mutual information quantities can be directly calculated, enabling evaluation of the tightness of each intermediate step. We show that our information-theoretical bounds depend on the statistics of the stochastic gradients evaluated along with the iterates, and are rigorously tighter than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

However, existing methods heavily rely on a unified decision-making module or heuristic rules, while neglecting to distinguish the roles of different decision procedures, as well as the mutual influences between them. To address this, we propose a novel Director-Actor Hierarchical Conversational Recommender (DAHCR), where the director selects the most effective option, followed by the actor accordingly choosing primitive actions that satisfy user preferences. Specifically, we develop a dynamic hypergraph to model user preferences and introduce an intrinsic motivation to train from weak supervision over the director.

To address this issue, we propose a novel framework from the perspective of clustering, which includes the following two parts. First, pseudo-label ensembling generates incomplete but high-quality pseudo-label sequences, where the frames in ambiguous intervals have no pseudo-labels. Second, iterative clustering iteratively propagates the pseudo-labels to the ambiguous intervals by clustering, and thus updates the pseudo-label sequences to train the model.

The 2D projections contain rich texture and semantic information but are highly dependent on viewpoints, while the 3D point clouds are more sensitive to geometry distortions and invariant to viewpoints. Therefore, to leverage the advantages of both point cloud and projected image modalities, we propose a novel no-reference Multi-Modal Point Cloud Quality Assessment (MM-PCQA) metric. In specific, we split the point clouds into sub-models to represent local geometry distortions such as point shift and down-sampling. Then we render the point clouds into 2D image projections for texture feature extraction.

In contrast to the previous small-loss heuristics, we leverage the observation that deep network is easy to memorize and hard to forget clean data. In particular, we measure the difficulty of memorization and forgetting for each instance via the transition times between being misclassified and being memorized in training, and integrate them into a novel metric for selection. Based on the proposed metric, we retain a subset of identified clean data and repeat the selection procedure to iteratively refine the clean subset, which is finally used for model training.

This paper migrates from the current convention to using exploration as a key to safety by learning safety as a robust behavior that completely excludes any behavioral pattern responsible for safety violations. Adversarial Behavior Exclusion for Safe RL (AdvEx-RL) learns a behavioral representation of the agent’s safety violations by approximating an optimal adversary utilizing exploration and later uses this representation to learn a separate safety policy that excludes those unsafe behaviors. In addition, AdvEx-RL ensures safety in a task-agnostic manner by acting as a safety firewall and therefore can be integrated with any RL task policy. We demonstrate the robustness of AdvEx-RL via comprehensive experiments in standard constrained Markov decision processes (CMDP) environments under 2 white-box action space perturbations as well as with changes in environment dynamics against 7 baselines. Consistently, AdvEx-RL outperforms the baselines by achieving an average safety performance of over 75% in the continuous action space with 10 times more variations in the testing environment dynamics.

As a result, we obtain accurate sequence-level classification and, subsequently, repertoire-level classification. Experiments on the Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Cancer datasets demonstrate our method’s effectiveness and superior performance on sequence-level and repertoire-level tasks.

Furthermore, the probability that a spreader diffuses the rumor decreases over time until they fully lose their interest and stop spreading.\n\nWe focus on determining the graph parameters which govern the magnitude and pace that the rumor spreads in this model. We prove that for the rumor to spread to a sizable fraction of the individuals, the network needs to enjoy “strong” expansion properties and most nodes should be in “well-connected” communities. Both of these characteristics are, arguably, present in real-world social networks up to a certain degree, shedding light on the driving force behind the extremely fast spread of rumors in social networks.\n\nFurthermore, we formulate a large range of countermeasures to cease the spread of a rumor.

Offline reinforcement learning promises to alleviate this issue by exploiting the vast amount of observational data available in the real world. However, observational data may mislead the learning agent to undesirable outcomes if the behavior policy that generates the data depends on unobserved random variables (i.e., confounders). In this paper, we propose two deconfounding methods in DRL to address this problem. The methods first calculate the importance degree of different samples based on the causal inference technique, and then adjust the impact of different samples on the loss function by reweighting or resampling the offline dataset to ensure its unbiasedness. These deconfounding methods can be flexibly combined with existing model-free DRL algorithms such as soft actor-critic and deep Q-learning, provided that a weak condition can be satisfied by the loss functions of these algorithms.

Existing solutions always adopt kinematic results as reference motions, and the physics is treated as a post-processing module. However, due to the depth ambiguity, monocular motion capture inevitably suffers from noises, and the noisy reference often leads to failure for physics-based tracking. To address the obstacles, our key-idea is to employ physics as denoising guidance in the reverse diffusion process to reconstruct physically plausible human motion from a modeled pose probability distribution. Specifically, we first train a latent gaussian model that encodes the uncertainty of 2D-to-3D lifting to facilitate reverse diffusion. Then, a physics module is constructed to track the motion sampled from the distribution. The discrepancies between the tracked motion and image observation are used to provide explicit guidance for the reverse diffusion model to refine the motion. With several iterations, the physics-based tracking and kinematic denoising promote each other to generate a physically plausible human motion.

To solve this problem, we formalize it as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem and utilize multivalued decision diagrams (MDD), a well-known data structure to deal with constraints. In our context, one key strength of MDD is to compute an exhaustive set of solutions without performing any search. Once the sentences are obtained, we apply a language model (GPT-2) to keep the best ones. We detail this for English and also for French where the agreement and conjugation rules are known to be more complex. Finally, with the help of GPT-2, we get hundreds of bona-fide candidate sentences. When compared with the few dozen sentences usually available in the well-known vision screening test (MNREAD), this brings a major breakthrough in the field of standardized sentence generation. Also, as it can be easily adapted for other languages, it has the potential to make the MNREAD test even more valuable and usable.

In this paper, through a human-subject experiment, we first show that in AI-assisted decision making, the timing of the attacks largely influences how much humans decrease their trust in and reliance on AI—the decrease is particularly salient when attacks occur on decision making tasks that humans are highly confident themselves. Based on these insights, we next propose an algorithmic framework to infer the human decision maker’s hidden trust in the AI model and dynamically decide when the attacker should launch an attack to the model.

To address these problems, we propose a novel robust steganography without embedding method in this paper. In particular, we design a secure weight modulation-based generator by introducing secure factors to hide secret messages in synthesised container images. In this manner, the synthesised results are modulated by secure factors and thus the secret messages are inaccessible when using fake factors, thus reducing the risk of message leakage. Furthermore, we design a difference predictor via the reconstruction of tampered container images together with an adversarial training strategy to iteratively update the estimation of hidden messages. This ensures robustness of recovering hidden messages, while degradation of synthesis fidelity is reduced since the generator is not included in the adversarial training.

To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness-aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness-aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.

The construction information enables effective re-editing of parametric CAD models. While boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard format for representing geometry structures, JSON format is an alternative due to the lack of uniform criteria for storing the construction workflow. Regrettably, most CAD models available on the Internet only offer geometry information, omitting the construction procedure and hampering creation efficiency. This paper proposes a learning approach CADParser to infer the underlying modeling sequences given a B-Rep CAD model. It achieves this by treating the CAD geometry structure as a graph and the construction workflow as a sequence. Since the existing CAD dataset only contains two operations (i.e., Sketch and Extrusion), limiting the diversity of the CAD model creation, we also introduce a large-scale dataset incorporating a more comprehensive range of operations such as Revolution, Fillet, and Chamfer.

They are well-suited for complex learning tasks in industrial applications. However, large-scale models pose significant challenges for training under the current Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Existing approaches for efficient FL training often leverage model parameter dropout. However, manipulating individual model parameters is not only inefficient in meaningfully reducing the communication overhead when training  large-scale FL models, but may also be detrimental to the scaling efforts and model performance as shown by recent research. To address these issues, we propose the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout (FedOBD) approach. The key novelty is that it decomposes large-scale models into semantic blocks so that FL participants can opportunistically upload quantized blocks, which are deemed to be significant towards training the model, to the FL server for aggregation. Extensive experiments evaluating FedOBD against four state-of-the-art approaches based on multiple real-world datasets show that it reduces the overall communication overhead by more than 88% compared to the best performing baseline approach, while achieving the highest test accuracy.

Successfully processing larger graphs may require an other GNN, and so on. Second, it concerns the power to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, not the power to approximate general functions on graphs, and the former does not necessarily imply the latter.\nIt is desired that a GNN’s usability will not be limited to graphs of any specific size. Therefore, we explore the realm of unrestricted-size expressivity. We prove that basic functions, which can be computed exactly by Mean or Max GNNs, are inapproximable by any Sum GNN.

Moreover, existing methods suffer from the interference of identity information, thus limiting the discriminative ability of the expression features. We exploit the idea of domain generalization (DG) and propose a representation disentanglement model to address the above problems. Specifically, we learn three independent potential subspaces corresponding to the domain, expression, and identity information from facial images. Meanwhile, the extracted expression and identity features are recovered as Fourier phase information reconstructed images, thereby ensuring that the high-level semantics of images remain unchanged after disentangling the domain information. Our proposed method can disentangle expression features from expression-irrelevant ones (i.e., identity and domain features). Therefore, the learned expression features exhibit sufficient domain invariance and discriminative ability.

We consider simple adjudication mechanisms that use (1) majority voting to decide the final verdict and (2) a payment function to reward the agents with the majority vote and possibly punish the ones in the minority. Agents interact with such a mechanism strategically: they exert some effort to understand how to properly judge the dispute and cast a yes/no vote that depends on this understanding and on information they have about the rest of the votes. Eventually, they vote so that their utility (i.e., their payment from the mechanism minus the cost due to their effort) is maximized.

On each non-root tree node, a new aggregation function and condition structural entropy are designed to achieve hierarchical state abstraction and compensate for sampling-induced essential information loss in state abstraction. Empirical evaluations on a visual gridworld domain and six continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with five SOTA state abstraction approaches, SISA significantly improves mean episode reward and sample efficiency up to 18.98 and 44.44%, respectively. Besides, we experimentally show that SISA is a general framework that can be flexibly integrated with different representation-learning objectives to improve their performances further.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1099>>title": "LGPConv: Learnable Gaussian Perturbation Convolution for Lightweight Pansharpening", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1099>>abstract": "Pansharpening is a crucial and challenging task that aims to obtain a high spatial resolution image by merging a multispectral (MS) image and a panchromatic (PAN) image.

To handle these problems, we propose Virtual Overbridge Linking (Violin), a generic framework to enhance the learning capacity of common GNNs. By learning to add virtual overbridges between two nodes that are estimated to be semantic-consistent, labeled and unlabeled data can be correlated. Supervised information can be well utilized in training while simultaneously inducing the model to learn from unlabeled data. Discriminative relation patterns extracted from unlabeled nodes can also be shared with other nodes even if they are remote from each other. Motivated by recent advances in data augmentations, we additionally integrate Violin with the consistency regularized training. Such a scheme yields node representations with better robustness, which significantly enhances a GNN. Violin can be readily extended to a wide range of GNNs without introducing additional learnable parameters.

However, they are all based on homophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the widely existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs.

To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace clustering method with anchor graph (DMCAG). To be specific, DMCAG firstly learns the embedded features for each view independently, which are used to obtain the subspace representations. To significantly reduce the complexity, we construct an anchor graph with small size for each view. Then, spectral clustering is performed on an integrated anchor graph to obtain pseudo-labels.

We pull the local node towards the global node of the same class and push them away from the global node of different classes. Second, we postulate that a well-structural graph neural network possesses similarity for neighbors due to the inherent adjacency relationships.

As a multimodal task, an essential aspect of PNG is the visual-linguistic interaction between image and caption. The previous two-stage method aggregates visual contexts from offline-generated mask proposals to phrase features, which tend to be noisy and fragmentary. The recent one-stage method aggregates only pixel contexts from image features to phrase features, which may incur semantic misalignment due to lacking object priors. To realize more comprehensive visual-linguistic interaction, we propose to enrich phrases with coupled pixel and object contexts by designing a Phrase-Pixel-Object Transformer Decoder (PPO-TD), where both fine-grained part details and coarse-grained entity clues are aggregated to phrase features. In addition, we also propose a Phrase-Object Contrastive Loss (POCL) to pull closer the matched phrase-object pairs and push away unmatched ones for aggregating more precise object contexts from more phrase-relevant object tokens.

Driven by the independent assumption, existing works have made great progress in handling single-view data. However, it is a non-trivial problem that extends them to multi-view time series data because of two main challenges: (i) the complex data structure, such as temporal dependency, can result in violation of the independent assumption; (ii) the factors from different views are generally overlapped and are hard to be aggregated to a complete set. In this work, we propose a novel framework MuLTI that employs the contrastive learning technique to invert the data generative process for enhanced identifiability. Additionally, MuLTI integrates a permutation mechanism that merges corresponding overlapped variables by the establishment of an optimal transport formula.

For such a setting, a model must first retrieve relevant images from the pool and answer the question from these retrieved images. We refer to this problem as retrieval-based visual question answering (or RETVQA in short). The RETVQA is distinctively different and more challenging than the traditionally-studied Visual Question Answering (VQA), where a given question has to be answered with a single relevant image in context. Towards solving the RETVQA task, we propose a unified Multi Image BART (MI-BART) that takes a question and retrieved images using our relevance encoder for free-form fluent answer generation. Further, we introduce the largest dataset in this space, namely RETVQA, which has the following salient features: multi-image and retrieval requirement for VQA, metadata-independent questions over a pool of heterogeneous images, expecting a mix of classification-oriented and open-ended generative answers. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76.5% and a fluency of 79.3% on the proposed dataset, namely RETVQA and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.9% and 11.8% on the image segment of the publicly available WebQA dataset on the accuracy and fluency metrics, respectively.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1268>>title": "Towards Semantics- and Domain-Aware Adversarial Attacks", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1268>>abstract": "Language models are known to be vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the input to mislead DNNs. It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to identify the deficiencies of DNNs before real-world deployment. However, existing word-level attacks have two major deficiencies: (1) They may change the semantics of the original sentence. (2) The generated adversarial sample can appear unnatural to humans due to the introduction of out-of-domain substitute words. In this paper, to address such drawbacks, we propose a semantics- and domain-aware word-level attack method. Specifically, we greedily replace the important words in a sentence with the ones suggested by a language model. The language model is trained to be semantics- and domain-aware via contrastive learning and in-domain pre-training. Furthermore, to balance the quality of adversarial examples and the attack success rate, we propose an iterative updating framework to optimize the contrastive learning loss and the in-domain pre-training loss in circular order.

However, time series data also contain abundant local temporal dependencies, which are often overlooked in the literature and significantly hinder forecasting performance. To address this issue, we introduce SMARTformer, which stands for SeMi-AutoRegressive Transformer. SMARTformer utilizes the Integrated Window Attention (IWA) and Semi-AutoRegressive (SAR) Decoder to capture global and local dependencies from both encoder and decoder perspectives. IWA conducts local self-attention in multi-scale windows and global attention across windows with linear com- plexity to achieve complementary clues in local and enlarged receptive fields. SAR generates subsequences iteratively, similar to autoregressive (AR) decoding, but refines the entire sequence in a NAR manner. This way, SAR benefits from both the global horizon of NAR and the local detail capturing of AR. We also introduce the Time-Independent Embedding (TIE), which better captures local dependencies by avoiding entanglements of various periods that can occur when directly adding po- sitional embedding to value embedding. Our ex- tensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SMARTformer against state-of-the-art models, achieving an improvement of 10.2% and 18.4% in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting, respectively.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1310>>title": "Fairness via Group Contribution Matching", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1310>>abstract": "Fairness issues in Deep Learning models have recently received increasing attention due to their significant societal impact.

In this study, we propose analyzing the contribution of each subgroup (i.e., a group of data with the same sensitive attribute) in the training process to understand the cause of such bias development process. We propose a gradient-based metric to assess training subgroup contribution disparity, showing that unequal contributions from different subgroups are one source of such unfairness. One way to balance the contribution of each subgroup is through oversampling, which ensures that an equal number of samples are drawn from each subgroup during each training iteration. However, we have found that even with a balanced number of samples, the contribution of each group remains unequal, resulting in unfairness under the oversampling strategy. To address the above issues, we propose an easy but effective group contribution matching (GCM) method to match the contribution of each subgroup.

The phenomenon brings challenges to the diagram visual grounding. To solve the above issues, we propose a gestalt-perceptual attention model to align the diagram objects and language expressions. For low-level visual features, inspired by the gestalt that simulates human visual system, we build a gestalt-perception graph network to make up the features learned by the traditional backbone network.

Although previous works have created generation capacity for CLIP through additional language models, a modality gap between the CLIP representations of different modalities and the inability of CLIP to model the offset of this gap, which results in the failure of the concept to transfer across modes.

We find that motivational diversity within teams is beneficial in dynamic collaborative environments, especially as the task risk level increases. Furthermore, we observed that the best composition in terms of the performance metrics used to evaluate team compositions, does not remain the same as the collaboration level required to achieve goals changes.

This paper addresses the challenge by presenting a depth registration method for merging the source contents seamlessly into the 3D space that the target image represents. Thus, the occlusions between the source contents and target contents can be conveniently handled through pixel-wise depth comparisons, allowing the user to more efficiently focus on the designs for image composition.

This is based on the basic IID assumption for real data in machine learning. However, though the source samples {z} obey IID, the generations {G(z)} may not necessarily be IID sampling from the target distribution. Based on this observation, considering a necessary condition of IID generation, we propose a new loss to encourage the closeness between the inverse samples of real data and the Gaussian source in the latent space to regularize the generation to be IID from the target distribution.

This task aims to predict nodes from unseen classes which are unobserved in the training process. Existing work mainly utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to associate features’ prototypes and labels’ semantics thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. However, the multi-faceted semantic orientation in the feature-semantic alignment has been neglected by previous work, i.e. the content of a node usually covers diverse topics that are relevant to the semantics of multiple labels. It’s necessary to separate and judge the semantic factors that tremendously affect the cognitive ability to improve the generality of models. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted framework (KMF) that enhances the richness of label semantics via the extracted KG (Knowledge Graph)-based topics. And then the content of each node is reconstructed to a topic-level representation that offers multi-faceted and fine-grained semantic relevancy to different labels. Due to the particularity of the graph’s instance (i.e., node) representation, a novel geometric constraint is developed to alleviate the problem of prototype drift caused by node information aggregation.

Our study provides an explanation for this paradox: instead of learning to emulate the correct reasoning function, BERT has, in fact, learned statistical features that inherently exist in logical reasoning problems. We also show that it is infeasible to jointly remove statistical features from data, illustrating the difficulty of learning to reason in general.

A learnware comprises a trained model and the specification which enables the model to be adequately identified according to the user’s requirement. Previous studies concentrated on the homogeneous case where models share the same feature space based on Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) specification. However, in real-world scenarios, models are typically constructed from different feature spaces. If such a scenario can be handled by the market, all models built for a particular task even with different feature spaces can be identified and reused for a new user task. Generally, this problem would be easier if there were additional auxiliary data connecting different feature spaces, however, obtaining such data in reality is challenging. In this paper, we present a general framework for accommodating heterogeneous learnwares without requiring additional auxiliary data. The key idea is to utilize the submitted RKME specifications to establish the relationship between different feature spaces. Additionally, we give a matrix factorization-based implementation and propose the overall procedure for constructing and exploiting the heterogeneous learnware market.

To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics.

Advertisers in automated bidding evaluate the cumulative utilities and have private financial constraints over multiple ad auctions in a long-term period. Based on these distinct features, we consider a new ad auction model for automated bidding: the values of advertisers are public while the financial constraints, such as budget and return on investment (ROI) rate, are private types. We derive the truthfulness conditions with respect to private constraints for this multi-dimensional setting, and demonstrate any feasible allocation rule could be equivalently reduced to a series of non-decreasing functions on budget. However, the resulted allocation mapped from these non-decreasing functions generally follows an irregular shape, making it difficult to obtain a closed-form expression for the auction objective. To overcome this design difficulty, we propose a family of truthful automated bidding auction with personalized rank scores, similar to the Generalized Second-Price (GSP) auction. The intuition behind our design is to leverage personalized rank scores as the criteria to allocate items, and compute a critical ROI to transforms the constraints on budget to the same dimension as ROI. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed auction mechanism outperforms the widely used ad auctions, such as first-price auction and second-price auction, in various automated bidding environments.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2144>>title": "Stochastic Feature Averaging for Learning with Long-Tailed Noisy Labels", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2144>>abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown promising results on a wide variety of tasks using large-scale and well-annotated training datasets.

Previous efforts on long-tailed learning and label-noise learning can only address a single type of data bias, leading to a severe deterioration of their performance. In this paper, we propose a distance-based sample selection algorithm called Stochastic Feature Averaging (SFA), which fits a Gaussian using the exponential running average of class centroids to capture uncertainty in representation space due to label noise and data scarcity. With SFA, we detect noisy samples based on their distances to class centroids sampled from this Gaussian distribution.

Extensive experimental results show that SFA can enhance the performance of existing methods on both simulated and real-world datasets.

The second framework is based on the more recent and refined notion of causal treewidth which is directed towards models with functional dependencies such as SCMs. Our results are constructive and based on bounding the (causal) treewidth of twin networks—used in standard counterfactual reasoning that contemplates two worlds, real and imaginary—to the (causal) treewidth of the underlying SCM structure. In particular, we show that the latter (causal) treewidth is no more than twice the former plus one. Hence, if associational or interventional reasoning is tractable on a fully specified SCM then counterfactual reasoning is tractable too. We extend our results to general counterfactual reasoning that requires contemplating more than two worlds and discuss applications of our results to counterfactual reasoning with partially specified SCMs that are coupled with data.

Particularly, CL sequences the learning process in a curriculum of increasing complexity tasks, which allows learning on large instances that otherwise would be impossible to learn from scratch. In this paper, we present a size-agnostic model that enables us to demonstrate that current curriculum strategies have a major impact on the quality of the solution inferred. In addition, we introduce a novel Reinforced Adaptive Staircase Curriculum Learning (RASCL) strategy, which adjusts the difficulty level during the learning process by revisiting the worst-performing instances.

To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for exploring safety supervision with three elaborate strategies: Label Safety, Sample Safety, and Parameter Safety. Firstly, to select reliable pseudo-labels, we define and adjust the confidence threshold in a self-adaptive manner according to the test-time learning status. Secondly, a soft-weighted contrastive learning module is presented to explore the highly-correlated samples and discriminate uncorrelated ones, improving the instantaneous efficiency of the model.

Such an assumption is often untenable beyond applications, especially when dealing with discrete-time event sequences in low-resolution; and typical discrete Hawkes processes mainly suffer from identifiability issues raised by the instantaneous effect, i.e., the causal relationship that occurred simultaneously due to the low-resolution data will not be captured by Granger causality. In this work, we propose Structure Hawkes Processes (SHPs) that leverage the instantaneous effect for learning the causal structure among events type in discrete-time event sequence. The proposed method is featured with the Expectation-Maximization of the likelihood function and a sparse optimization scheme.

Human speech can contain a lot of user-sensitive information, such as gender, identity, and sensitive content. New types of security and privacy breaches have thus emerged. Users do not want to expose their personal sensitive information to malicious attacks by untrusted third parties. Thus, the SLU system needs to ensure that a potential malicious attacker cannot deduce the sensitive attributes of the users, while it should avoid greatly compromising the SLU accuracy. To address the above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SLU multi-task privacy-preserving model to prevent both the speech recognition (ASR) and identity recognition (IR) attacks. The model uses the hidden layer separation technique so that SLU information is distributed only in a specific portion of the hidden layer, and the other two types of information are removed to obtain a privacy-secure hidden layer. In order to achieve good balance between efficiency and privacy, we introduce a new mechanism of model pre-training, namely joint adversarial training, to further enhance the user privacy.

But in real-life, models are of ten applied on data with new classes, which can lead to massive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance. Hence, developing\n open-set classification methods is crucial to determine if a given sample belongs to a known class. Existing methods for open-set node classification generally use transductive learning with part or all\n of the features of real unseen class nodes to help with open-set classification. In this paper, we propose a novel generative open-set node classification method, i.e., G2Pxy, which follows a stricter inductive learning setting where no information about unknown classes is available during training and validation. Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and external unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the distribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set classifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an extra proxy classifier. Under the constraints\n of both cross entropy loss and complement entropy loss, G2Pxy achieves superior effectiveness for unknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by experiments on bench\nmark graph datasets. Moreover, G2Pxy does not have specific requirement on the GNN architecture and shows good generalizations.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2366>>title": "Enabling Abductive Learning to Exploit Knowledge Graph", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2366>>abstract": "Most systems integrating data-driven machine learning with knowledge-driven reasoning usually rely on a specifically designed knowledge base to enable efficient symbolic inference. However, it could be cumbersome for the nonexpert end-users to prepare such a knowledge base in real tasks. Recent years have witnessed the success of large-scale knowledge graphs, which could be ideal domain knowledge resources for real-world machine learning tasks. However, these large-scale knowledge graphs usually contain much information that is irrelevant to a specific learning task. Moreover, they often contain a certain degree of noise. Existing methods can hardly make use of them because the large-scale probabilistic logical inference is usually intractable. To address these problems, we present ABductive Learning with Knowledge Graph (ABL-KG) that can automatically mine logic rules from knowledge graphs during learning, using a knowledge forgetting mechanism for filtering out irrelevant information. Meanwhile, these rules can form a logic program that enables efficient joint optimization of the machine learning model and logic inference within the Abductive Learning (ABL) framework. Experiments on four different tasks show that ABL-KG can automatically extract useful rules from large-scale and noisy knowledge graphs, and significantly improve the performance of machine learning with only a handful of labeled data.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2409>>title": "DenseDINO: Boosting Dense Self-Supervised Learning with Token-Based Point-Level Consistency", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2409>>abstract": "In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective transformer framework for self-supervised learning called DenseDINO to learn dense visual representations.

Specifically, DenseDINO introduces some extra input tokens called reference tokens to match the point-level features with the position prior. With the reference token, the model could maintain spatial consistency and deal with multi-object complex scene images, thus generalizing better on dense prediction tasks.

However, the static graph is not general for complex cooperative tasks, and the parallel message-passing update in the undirected graph with cycles cannot guarantee convergence. To solve this problem, we propose Deep Hierarchical Communication Graph (DHCG) to learn the dependency relationships between agents based on their messages. The relationships are formulated as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the selection of the proper topology is viewed as an action and trained in an end-to-end fashion. To eliminate the cycles in the graph, we apply an acyclicity constraint as intrinsic rewards and then project the graph in the admissible solution set of DAGs. As a result, DHCG removes redundant communication edges for cost improvement and guarantees convergence. To show the effectiveness of the learned graphs, we propose policy-based and value-based DHCG. Policy-based DHCG factorizes the joint policy in an auto-regressive manner, and value-based DHCG factorizes the joint value function to individual value functions and pairwise payoff functions.

Recent years have witnessed increasing attention on prediction with only incomplete data consisting of observed features and a mask that indicates the missing pattern. Existing methods assume that the training and testing distributions are the same, which may be violated in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider prediction with incomplete data in the presence of distribution shift. We focus on the case where the underlying joint distribution of complete features and label is invariant, but the missing pattern, i.e., mask distribution may shift agnostically between training and testing. To achieve generalization, we leverage the observation that for each mask, there is an invariant optimal predictor. To avoid the exponential explosion when learning them separately, we approximate the optimal predictors jointly using a double parameterization technique. This has the undesirable side effect of allowing the learned predictors to rely on the intra-mask correlation and that between features and mask. We perform decorrelation to minimize this effect.

The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Evaluations show that DLGs outperform Language-Specific Program Generators (LSGs) in testing compilers.\nHowever, we argue that it is unfair to use LSGs as baselines to evaluate DLGs. LSGs aim to validate compiler optimizations by only generating compilable, well-defined test programs; this restriction inevitably impairs the diversity of the language features used in the generated programs. In contrast, DLGs do not aim to validate the correctness of compiler optimizations, and its generated programs are not guaranteed to be well-defined or even compilable.

This paper proposes an attention-based contrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called SkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for skeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention mask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the skeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local salient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature space. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding contrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global features, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the entire skeleton.

While TMs match or surpass deep learning accuracy for an increasing number of applications, large clause pools tend to produce clauses with many literals (long clauses). As such, they become less interpretable. Further, longer clauses increase the switching activity of the clause logic in hardware, consuming more power. This paper introduces a novel variant of TM learning — Clause Size Constrained TMs (CSC-TMs) —  where one can set a soft constraint on the clause size. As soon as a clause includes more literals than the constraint allows, it starts expelling literals. Accordingly, oversized clauses only appear transiently. To evaluate CSC-TM, we conduct classification, clustering, and regression experiments on tabular data, natural language text, images, and board games. Our results show that CSC-TM maintains accuracy with up to 80 times fewer literals. Indeed, the accuracy increases with shorter clauses for TREC and BBC Sports. After the accuracy peaks, it drops gracefully as the clause size approaches one literal. We finally analyze CSC-TM power consumption and derive new convergence properties.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>3138>>title": "Sketch Recognition via Part-based Hierarchical Analogical Learning", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>3138>>abstract": "Sketch recognition has been studied for decades, but it is far from solved.

The retrieval of these variables has been studied extensively in the disentanglement, causal representation learning, and independent component analysis fields. Recently, approaches merging these domains together have shown great success. Instead of directly representing the factors of variation, the problem of disentanglement can be seen as finding the interventions on one image that yield a change to a single factor. Following this assumption, we introduce a new method for disentanglement inspired by causal dynamics that combines causality theory with vector-quantized variational autoencoders. Our model considers the quantized vectors as causal variables and links them in a causal graph. It performs causal interventions on the graph and generates atomic transitions affecting a unique factor of variation in the image. We also introduce a new task of action retrieval that consists of finding the action responsible for the transition between two images. We test our method on standard synthetic and real-world disentanglement datasets. We show that it can effectively disentangle the factors of variation and perform precise interventions on high-level semantic attributes of an image without affecting its quality, even with imbalanced data distributions.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>3155>>title": "Exploring Structural Similarity in Fitness Landscapes via Graph Data Mining: A Case Study on Number Partitioning Problems", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>3155>>abstract": "One of the most common problem-solving heuristics is by analogy.

However, due to the black-box nature of combinatorial optimization, it is far from trivial to infer such similarity in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, by using local optima network as a proxy of fitness landscapes, this paper proposed to leverage graph data mining techniques to conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the latent topological structural information embedded in those landscapes. In our experiments, we use the number partitioning problem as the case and our empirical results are inspiring to support the overall assumption of the existence of structural similarity between landscapes within neighboring dimensions.

Many works study single-learner training-time attacks that \"pre-programme\" behavioral triggers into a strategy. However, attacks on collections of learning agents remain largely overlooked. We remedy the situation by developing a constructive training-time attack on a population of learning agents and additionally make the attack agnostic to the population’s size. The attack constitutes a sequence of environment (re)parameterizations (poisonings), generated to overcome individual differences between agents and lead the entire population to the same target behavior while minimizing effective environment modulation. Our method is demonstrated on populations of independent learners in \"ghost\" environments (learners do not interact or perceive each other) as well as environments with mutual awareness, with or without individual learning. From the attack perspective, we pursue an ultra-blackbox setting, i.e., the attacker’s training utilizes only across-policy traces of the victim learners for both attack conditioning and evaluation. The resulting uncertainty in population behavior is managed via a novel Wasserstein distance-based Gaussian embedding of behaviors detected within the victim population. To align with prior works on environment poisoning, our experiments are based on a 3D Grid World domain and show:  a) feasibility, i.e., despite the uncertainty, the attack forces a population-wide adoption of target behavior; b) efficacy, i.e., the attack is size-agnostic and transferable.

We achieve this based on the recent success of large-scale pretrained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, which provides a strong initial knowledge of image-text relationships.

The intrinsic motivation for artificial agents is modelled on the concept of human social motivation that entices humans to meet and understand each other, especially when experiencing a utility loss. Our intrinsic motivation encourages agents to stay near each other to obtain better observations and construct a model of others. They do so when their model of other agents is poor, or the overall task performance is bad during the learning phase.

To address this issue, we propose a novel loss function called multi-relation margin (MRM) loss that can plug in few-shot methods to boost the performance of FSOSR. MRM enlarges the margin between different classes by extracting the multi-relationship of paired samples to dynamically refine the decision boundary for known classes and implicitly delineate the distribution of unknowns. Specifically, MRM separates the classes by enforcing a margin while concentrating samples of the same class on a hypersphere with a learnable radius. In order to better capture the distribution information of each class, MRM extracts the similarity and correlations among paired samples, ameliorating the optimization of the margin and radius.

Usually, natural 3D U-Net is adopted as the standard site prediction framework to do per-voxel binary mask classification. However, this scheme only performs feature extraction for single-scale samples, which may bring the loss of global or local information, resulting in incomplete, artifacted or even missed predictions. To tackle this issue, we propose a network called GLPocket, which is based on the Lmser (Least mean square error reconstruction) network and utilizes multi-scale representation to predict binding sites. Firstly, GLPocket uses Target Cropping Block (TCB) for targeted prediction. TCB selects the local interested feature from the global representations to perform concentrated prediction, and reduces the volume of feature maps to be calculated by 82% without adding additional parameters. It integrates global distribution information into local regions, making prediction more concentrated on decoding stage. Secondly, GLPocket establishes long-range relationship of patches within the local region with Transformer Block (TB), to enrich local context semantic information. Experiments show that GLPocket improves by 0.5%-4% on DCA Top-n prediction compared with previous state-of-the-art methods on four datasets.

The key to our approach is to represent predicates in first-order logic using deep neural networks and then to approximately back-propagate through the HL-MRF and thus train every aspect of the first-order system being represented. We believe that this approach represents an interesting direction for the integration of deep learning and reasoning techniques with applications to knowledge base learning, multi-task learning, and explainability.

However, the split finding algorithm has long been criticized for its bias towards features with a large number of potential splits. This bias introduces severe interpretability and overfitting issues in GBDT. To this end, we provide a fine-grained analysis of bias in GBDT and demonstrate that the bias originates from 1) the systematic bias in the gain estimation of each split and 2) the bias in the split finding algorithm resulting from the use of the same data to evaluate the split improvement and determine the best split. Based on the analysis, we propose unbiased gain, a new unbiased measurement of gain importance using out-of-bag samples. Moreover, we incorporate the unbiased property into the split finding algorithm and develop UnbiasedGBM to solve the overfitting issue of GBDT. We assess the performance of UnbiasedGBM and unbiased gain in a large-scale empirical study comprising 60 datasets and show that: 1) UnbiasedGBM exhibits better performance than popular GBDT implementations such as LightGBM, XGBoost, and Catboost on average on the 60 datasets and 2) unbiased gain achieves better average performance in feature selection than popular feature importance methods.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>3636>>title": "Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation in Graph Transfer Learning", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>3636>>abstract": "As a specific case of graph transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs aims for knowledge transfer from label-rich source graphs to unlabeled target graphs. However, graphs with topology and attributes usually have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph. This imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain shifts and label scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA). To deal with the domain shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of node embedding. Thus, the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be transferred to the target nodes. Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their relative position to the class centroids.

Computing general solutions with correctness guarantee has long been a key issue in GP. Abstractions are widely used to solve GP problems. For example, a popular abstraction model for GP is qualitative numeric planning (QNP), which extends classical planning with non-negative real variables that can be increased or decreased by some arbitrary amount. The refinement of correct solutions of sound abstractions are solutions with correctness guarantees for GP problems. Recently, Cui et al. proposed a uniform abstraction framework for GP. They gave model-theoretic definitions of sound and complete abstractions for GP problems. In this paper, based on Cui et al.’s work, we explore automatic verification of sound abstractions for GP. Firstly, we present a proof-theoretic characterization for sound abstractions. Secondly, based on the characterization, we give a first-order verifiable sufficient condition for sound abstractions with deterministic actions.   Then we study how to verify the sufficient condition when the abstraction models are bounded QNPs where integer variables can be incremented or decremented by one. To this end, we develop methods to handle counting and transitive closure, which are often used to define numerical variables.

Heuristics have been proposed to address NEP. However, a hand-engineered heuristic often has significant performance limitations. A recently proposed model solving NEP by reinforcement learning has shown superior performance than heuristics on in-distribution datasets. However, their model shows considerably inferior out-of-distribution generalization ability when enhancing networks against the degree-based targeted attack.

However, such an assumption can be broken by advanced feature-hidden backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel detection framework, dubbed Orion (online backdoor sample detection via evolution deviance).

Additionally, we put forward a scheme to restore the original label of backdoor samples, enabling more robust predictions. Extensive experiments on six attacks, three datasets, and two architectures verify the effectiveness of Orion.

The ICS problem aims to find a cover of a set S, such that the elements in the cover define a unique signature for each of the elements of S, and to minimise the cover’s cardinality. In this work, we study a generalised identifying code set (GICS) problem, where a unique signature must be found for each subset of S that has a cardinality of at most k (instead of just each element of S). The concept of an independent support of a Boolean formula was introduced by Chakraborty et al. in 2014 to speed up propositional model counting, by identifying a subset of variables whose truth assignments uniquely define those of the other variables.\n\nIn this work, we introduce an extended version of independent support, grouped independent support (GIS), and show how to reduce the GICS problem to the GIS problem. We then propose a new solving method for finding a GICS, based on finding a GIS. We show that the prior state-of-the-art approaches yield integer-linear programming (ILP) models whose sizes grow exponentially with the problem size and k, while our GIS encoding only grows polynomially with the problem size and k. While the ILP approach can solve the GICS problem on networks of at most 494 nodes, the GIS-based method can handle networks of up to 21 363 nodes; a ∼40× improvement. The GIS-based method shows up to a 520× improvement on the ILP-based method in terms of median solving time.

In these games, agents select available resources and their utility then depends on the number of agents using the same resources. This implies that there is no distinction between the agents, i.e., they are anonymous.\n\nWe depart from this very general setting by proposing Resource Selection Games with heterogeneous agents that strive for a joint resource usage with similar agents. So, instead of the number of other users of a given resource, our model considers agents with different types and the decisive feature is the fraction of same-type agents among the users. More precisely, similarly to Schelling Games, there is a tolerance threshold tau in [0,1] which specifies the agents’ desired minimum fraction of same-type agents on a resource. Agents strive to select resources where at least a tau-fraction of those resources’ users have the same type as themselves. For tau=1, our model generalizes hedonic diversity games with single-peaked utilities with a peak at 1. \n\nFor our general model, we consider the existence and quality of equilibria and the complexity of maximizing the social welfare. Additionally, we consider a bounded rationality model, where agents can only estimate the utility of a resource, since they only know the fraction of same-type agents on a given resource, but not the exact numbers. Thus, they cannot know the impact a strategy change would have on a target resource.

We find that, under certain restrictions on the relative amounts of evidence, together with the actions available to the agents, there exist deliberation protocols in each of the two families we look at (i.e., simultaneous and sequential) that offer desirable guarantees.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first interactive text-based gaming framework that consists of daily real-world human activities designed using scripts dataset. We provide gaming environments for 10 daily activities and perform a detailed analysis of the proposed environment. We develop reinforcement learning based baseline models/agents to play the games in ScriptWorld. To understand the role of language models in such environments, we leverage features obtained from pre-trained language models in the RL agents.

Existing model predictive control (MPC) methods learn from a set of discrete states visited by previous (sub-)optimized trajectories and thus result in computationally expensive mixed-integer nonlinear optimization. In this paper a novel MPC method is proposed based on reach-avoid analysis to solve the controller synthesis problem iteratively. The reach-avoid analysis is concerned with computing a reach-avoid set which is a set of initial states such that the system can reach the target set successfully. It not only provides terminal constraints, which ensure feasibility of MPC, but also expands discrete states in existing methods into a continuous set (i.e., reach-avoid sets) and thus leads to nonlinear optimization which is more computationally tractable online due to the absence of integer variables.

Drawing on continual learning mechanisms during child growth and development, we propose Dynamic Structure Development of Spiking Neural Networks (DSD-SNN) for efficient and adaptive continual learning. When learning a sequence of tasks, the DSD-SNN dynamically assigns and grows new neurons to new tasks and prunes redundant neurons, thereby increasing memory capacity and reducing computational overhead. In addition, the overlapping shared structure helps to quickly leverage all acquired knowledge to new tasks, empowering a single network capable of supporting multiple incremental tasks (without the separate sub-network mask for each task). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on multiple class incremental learning and task incremental learning benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our model could significantly improve performance, learning speed and memory capacity, and reduce computational overhead.

In this paper, we propose a document-level RE model with a Graph-Transformer Network (GTN). The GTN includes two core sublayers: 1) the graph-attention sublayer that simultaneously models global and local contexts of nodes in the document graph; 2) the cross-attention sublayer, enabling GTN to capture the non-entity clue information from the document encoder.

Driven by the advancement of hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs), we expect them to fully capture high-order interaction patterns behind the hypergraph formulated by DMD associations and realize sound prediction performance. However, the confirmed DMD associations are insufficient due to the high cost of in vitro screening, which forms a sparse DMD hypergraph and thus brings in suboptimal generalization ability. To mitigate the limitation, we propose a Multi-view Contrastive Learning Hypergraph Neural Network, named MCHNN, for DMD association prediction. We design a novel multi-view contrastive learning on the DMD hypergraph as an auxiliary task, which guides the HGNN to learn more discriminative representations and enhances the generalization ability.

The key is that the basic assumption of these methods — a surface point is consistent when rendered from different views — doesn’t hold for drawings. In a portrait drawing, the appearance of a facial point may changes when viewed from different angles. Besides, portrait drawings usually present little 3D information and suffer from insufficient training data. To combat this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware GEnerator (SAGE) for synthesizing multi-view portrait drawings. Our motivation is that facial semantic labels are view-consistent and correlate with drawing techniques. We therefore propose to collaboratively synthesize multi-view semantic maps and the corresponding portrait drawings. To facilitate training, we design a semantic-aware domain translator, which generates portrait drawings based on features of photographic faces. In addition, use data augmentation via synthesis to mitigate collapsed results. We apply SAGE to synthesize multi-view portrait drawings in diverse artistic styles.

We propose a novel depth estimation model named RElative Depth Transformer (RED-T) that uses relative depth as guidance in self-attention. Specifically, the model assigns high attention weights to pixels of close depth and low attention weights to pixels of distant depth. As a result, the features of similar depth can become more likely to each other and thus less prone to misused visual hints. We show that the proposed model achieves competitive results in monocular depth estimation benchmarks and is less biased to RGB information.

We consider a practical threat scenario where no extra knowledge about the FL system (e.g., aggregation rules or updates on benign devices) is available to adversaries. FMPA exploits the global historical information to construct an estimator that predicts the next round of the global model as a benign reference. It then fine-tunes the reference model to obtain the desired poisoned model with low accuracy and small perturbations. Besides the goal of causing DoS, FMPA can be naturally extended to launch a fine-grained controllable attack, making it possible to precisely reduce the global accuracy. Armed with precise control, malicious FL service providers can gain advantages over their competitors without getting noticed, hence opening a new attack surface in FL other than DoS.

We target symbolic music, where notes are explicitly encoded, and model this task as a Multi-Trajectory Tracking (MTT) problem from discrete observations, i.e., notes in a pitch-time space. Our approach builds a graph from a musical piece, by creating one node for every note, and separates the melodic trajectories by predicting a link between two notes if they are consecutive in the same voice/stream. This kind of local, greedy prediction is made possible by node embeddings created by a heterogeneous graph neural network that can capture inter- and intra-trajectory information.

Several top streamers at the head level occupy a considerable amount of exposure, resulting in an unbalanced data distribution. A unified model for all levels without consideration of imbalance issue can be biased towards head streamers and neglect the conflicts between levels. The lack of inter-level streamer correlations and intra-level streamer characteristics modeling imposes obstacles to estimating the user behaviors. To tackle these challenges, we propose a curriculum multi-level learning framework for imbalanced recommendation. We separate model parameters into shared and level-specific ones to explore the generality among all levels and discrepancy for each level respectively. The level-aware gradient descent and a curriculum sampling scheduler are designed to capture the de-biased commonalities from all levels as the shared parameters. During the specific parameters training, the hardness-aware learning rate and an adaptor are proposed to dynamically balance the training process. Finally, shared and specific parameters are combined to be the final model weights and learned in a cooperative training framework.

Closed-book CQA, as one of the subtasks, requires the model to answer questions without retrieving external knowledge, which emphasizes the importance of the model’s problem-solving ability. Most previous methods relied on large-scale pre-trained models to generate question-related knowledge while ignoring the crucial role of skills in the process of answering commonsense questions. Generally, skills refer to the learned ability in performing a specific task or activity, which are derived from knowledge and experience. In this paper, we introduce a new approach named Dynamic Skill-aware Commonsense Question Answering (DSCQA), which transcends the limitations of traditional methods by informing the model about the need for each skill in questions and utilizes skills as a critical driver in CQA process. To be specific, DSCQA first employs commonsense skill extraction module to generate various skill representations. Then, DSCQA utilizes dynamic skill module to generate dynamic skill representations. Finally, in perception and emphasis module, various skills and dynamic skill representations are used to help question-answering process.

This paper extends  Nebel’s framework to the setting of bounded numeric planning. First, we identify a variety of numeric fragments differing on the degree of the polynomials involved and the availability of features such as conditional effects and Boolean conditions; then we study the compilability of these fragments to each other and to the classical fragments. Surprisingly, numeric and classical planning with conditional effects and Boolean conditions can be compiled both ways preserving plan size exactly, while the same does not hold when targeting pure STRIPS.

This paper presents Self-Recover, a deep learning framework to predict the block maxima of a time series by employing self-supervised learning to address the varying temporal data availability problem. Self-Recover uses a combination of contrastive and generative self-supervised schemes along with a denoising autoencoder component for imputing missing values. It combines a representation of the historical observations with a representation of the process model outputs using a residual learning approach while incorporating the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to ensure consistency of its block maxima predictions.

To address this issue, we propose the Cross-community Adapter Learning (CAL) framework, which combines adapters and transformer-based models to learn the meaning of norm violations expressed as textual sentences. Additionally, we analyze the differences in the meaning of norm violations between communities, using Integrated Gradients (IG) to understand the inner workings of our model and calculate a global relevance score that indicates the relevance of words for violation detection.

The size of the neighbourhood is determined by the `distance’ to the zero-sum game, as well as the exploration rates of the agents.

In this context, existing methods perform euclidean-based embedding clustering without ensuring the flatness and convexity of the latent manifolds. To address this problem, we incorporate two mechanisms. First, we introduce an overclustering loss to flatten the local curves. Second, we propose an adversarial mechanism to adjust the global geometric configuration. The second mechanism gradually transforms the latent structures into convex ones.

Learning vision-language alignment for VLN from limited data is challenging since visual observation and language instruction are both complex and diverse. Previous works only generate augmented data based on original scenes while failing to generate data samples from unseen scenes, which limits the generalization ability of the navigation agent. In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge-driven Environmental Dreamer (KED), a method that leverages the knowledge of the embodied environment and generates unseen scenes for a navigation agent to learn. Generating an unseen environment with texture consistency and structure consistency is challenging. To address this problem, we incorporate three knowledge-driven regularization objectives into the KED and adopt a reweighting mechanism for self-adaptive optimization. Our KED method is able to generate unseen embodied environments without extra annotations. We use KED to successfully generate 270 houses and 500K instruction-trajectory pairs. The navigation agent with the KED method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various VLN benchmarks, such as R2R, R4R, and RxR.

To solve the above issues, we propose a new distillation method named dual relation knowledge distillation (DRKD), including pixel-wise relation distillation and instance-wise relation distillation. The pixel-wise relation distillation embeds pixel-wise features in the graph space and applies graph convolution to capture the global pixel relation.

Thus, the instance-wise relation distillation is designed, which calculates the similarity of different instances to obtain a relation matrix. More importantly, a relation filter module is designed to highlight valuable instance relations.

In this work, we show that learning prototype classifiers addresses the biased softmax problem in LTR. Prototype classifiers can deliver promising results simply using Nearest-Class-Mean (NCM), a special case where prototypes are empirical centroids. We go one step further and propose to jointly learn prototypes by using distances to prototypes in representation space as the logit scores for classification. Further, we theoretically analyze the properties of Euclidean distance based prototype classifiers that lead to stable gradient-based optimization which is robust to outliers. To enable independent distance scales along each channel, we enhance Prototype classifiers by learning channel-dependent temperature parameters. Our analysis shows that prototypes learned by Prototype classifiers are better separated than empirical centroids.

But it also limits the capability of recovering high-frequency details when flat areas dominate the local searching window. To improve the above issues, we propose a novel self-refinement mechanism which could adaptively achieve texture-aware reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine procedure. Generally, the primary self-attention is first conducted to reconstruct the coarse-grained textures and detect the fine-grained regions required further compensation. Then, region selection attention is performed to refine the textures on these key regions. Since self-attention considers the channel information on tokens equally, we employ a dual-branch feature integration module to privilege the important channels in feature extraction.

Given that the problem here is to arrive at a population consisting of n+1 individuals witnessing the Pareto front, this is a surprisingly strong robustness to noise (comparably simple evolutionary algorithms cannot optimize the single-objective OneMax problem in polynomial time when p = omega(log(n)/n)). Our proofs suggest that the strong robustness of the MOEA stems from its implicit diversity mechanism designed to enable it to compute a population covering the whole Pareto front. \n \n Interestingly this result only holds when the objective value of a solution is determined only once and the algorithm from that point on works with this, possibly noisy, objective value. We prove that when all solutions are reevaluated in each iteration, then any noise rate p = omega(log(n)/n^2) leads to a super-polynomial runtime.

Specifically, we estimate the direct causal effect of attention to the final prediction, and then maximize such effect to guide attention attending to more meaningful neighbors. Our method can serve as a plug-and-play module for any canonical attention-based GNNs in an end-to-end fashion.

Due to the complexity of long-horizon control and coordination, most prior TSC methods leverage deep reinforcement learning (RL) to search for a control policy and have witnessed great success. However, TSC still faces two significant challenges. 1) The travel time of a vehicle is delayed feedback on the effectiveness of TSC policy at each traffic intersection since it is obtained after the vehicle has left the road network. Although several heuristic reward functions have been proposed as substitutes for travel time, they are usually biased and not leading the policy to improve in the correct direction. 2) The traffic condition of each intersection is influenced by the non-local intersections since vehicles traverse multiple intersections over time. Therefore, the TSC agent is required to leverage both the local observation and the non-local traffic conditions to predict the long-horizontal traffic conditions of each intersection comprehensively. To address these challenges, we propose DenseLight, a novel RL-based TSC method that employs an unbiased reward function to provide dense feedback on policy effectiveness and a non-local enhanced TSC agent to better predict future traffic conditions for more precise traffic control.

Despite the growing interest in this area, these generated explanations’ effectiveness and potential limitations remain poorly understood. A key concern is that these explanations, generated by LLMs, may lead to erroneous judgments about the nature of flagged content by both users and content moderators. For instance, an LLM-generated explanation might inaccurately convince a content moderator that a benign piece of content is  hateful. In light of this, we propose an analytical framework for examining hate speech explanations and conducted an extensive survey on evaluating such explanations. Specifically, we prompted GPT-3 to generate explanations for both hateful and non-hateful content, and a survey was conducted with 2,400 unique respondents to evaluate the generated explanations. Our findings reveal that (1) human evaluators rated the GPT-generated explanations as high quality in terms of linguistic fluency, informativeness, persuasiveness, and logical soundness, (2) the persuasive nature of these explanations, however, varied depending on the prompting strategy employed, and (3) this persuasiveness may result in incorrect judgments about the hatefulness of the content. Our study underscores the need for caution in applying LLM-generated explanations for content moderation.

Climate shifts such as global warming have led to massive and alarming loss of ice and snow in the high-latitude regions including the Arctic, causing many natural disasters due to sea-level rise, etc. Mitigating the impacts of climate change has also become a United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal for 2030. The recent launch of the ICESat-2 satellites target on heights in the polar regions. However, the observations are only available along very narrow scan lines, leaving large no-data gaps in-between. We aim to fill the gaps by combining the height observations with high-resolution satellite imagery that have large footprints (spatial coverage). The data expansion is a challenging task as the height data are often constrained on one or a few lines per image in real applications, and the images are highly noisy for height estimation. Related work on image-based height prediction and interpolation relies on specific types of images or does not consider the highly-localized height distribution. We propose a spatial self-corrective learning framework, which explicitly uses confidence-based pseudo-interpolation, recurrent self-refinement, and truth-based correction with a regression layer to address the challenges. We carry out experiments on different landscapes in the high-latitude regions and the proposed method shows stable improvements compared to the baseline methods.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5777>>title": "Long-term Wind Power Forecasting with Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Transformer", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5777>>abstract": "Wind power is attracting increasing attention around the world due to its renewable, pollution-free, and other advantages. However, safely and stably integrating the high permeability intermittent power energy into electric power systems remains challenging. Accurate wind power forecasting (WPF) can effectively reduce power fluctuations in power system operations. Existing methods are mainly designed for short-term predictions and lack effective spatial-temporal feature augmentation. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end wind power forecasting model named Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (HSTTN) to address the long-term WPF problems. Specifically, we construct an hourglass-shaped encoder-decoder framework with skip-connections to jointly model representations aggregated in hierarchical temporal scales, which benefits long-term forecasting. Based on this framework, we capture the inter-scale long-range temporal dependencies and global spatial correlations with two parallel Transformer skeletons and strengthen the intra-scale connections with downsampling and upsampling operations. Moreover, the complementary information from spatial and temporal features is fused and propagated in each other via Contextual Fusion Blocks (CFBs) to promote the prediction further. Extensive experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our HSTTN over existing solutions.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5778>>title": "Mimicking the Thinking Process for Emotion Recognition in Conversation with Prompts and Paraphrasing", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5778>>abstract": "Emotion recognition in conversation,  which aims to predict the emotion for all utterances,  has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. It is a challenging task since the  recognition of the emotion in one  utterance  involves many complex factors, such as the conversational context, the speaker’s  background, and the subtle difference between emotion labels. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which mimics the thinking process when modeling these factors. Specifically, we first comprehend the conversational context with a history-oriented prompt to selectively gather  information from predecessors of the target utterance. We then  model the speaker’s background with an experience-oriented prompt  to retrieve the similar utterances from all conversations.  We finally  differentiate the subtle label semantics with a paraphrasing mechanism  to elicit the intrinsic label related knowledge.\nWe conducted extensive experiments on three benchmarks.

The increase of online shopping affords an opportunity to provide consumers with actionable feedback on the social and environmental impact of potential purchases, at the exact moment when it is relevant. Unfortunately, consumers are inundated with ambiguous sustainability information. For example, greenwashing can make it difficult to identify environmentally friendly products. The highest-quality options, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) scores or tailored impact certificates (e.g., environmentally friendly tags), designed for assessing the environmental impact of consumption, are ineffective in the setting of online shopping. They are simply too costly to provide a feasible solution when scaled up, and often rely on data from self-interested market players. We contribute an analysis of this online environment, exploring how the dynamic between sellers and consumers surfaces claims and concerns regarding sustainable consumption.

Public consent and participation is the key factor in dealing with climate crises. However, discussions about climate change on Twitter are often influenced by the polarised beliefs that shape the discourse and divide it into communities of climate change deniers and believers. In our work, we propose a framework that helps identify different attitudes in tweets about climate change (deny, believe, ambiguous). Previous literature often lacks an efficient architecture or ignores the characteristics of climate-denier tweets. Moreover, the presence of various emotions with different levels of intensity turns out to be relevant for shaping discussions on climate change. Therefore, our paper utilizes emotion recognition and emotion intensity prediction as auxiliary tasks for our main task of stance detection. Our framework injects the words affecting the emotions embedded in the tweet to capture the overall representation of the attitude in terms of the emotions associated with it. The final task-specific and shared feature representations are fused with efficient embedding and attention techniques to detect the correct attitude of the tweet.

This problem takes a cropping calendar as input and aims at allocating crops to respect several constraints.  We have shown that it is possible to model both agroecological and operational constraints at the level of a small farm. Experiments on an organic micro-farm have shown that it is possible to combine these constraints to design very different cropping scenarios and that our approach can apply to real situations.

One major issue among many is that ML models do not perform equally well for underrepresented groups. This puts vulnerable populations in an even disadvantaged and unfavorable position. We propose an approach that leverages the power of web search and generative models to alleviate some of the shortcomings of discriminative models. We demonstrate our method on an image classification problem using ImageNet’s People Subtree subset, and show that it is effective in enhancing robustness and mitigating bias in certain classes that represent vulnerable populations (e.g., female doctor of color). Our new method is able to (1) identify weak decision boundaries for such classes; (2) construct search queries for Google as well as text for generating images through DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion; and (3) show how these newly captured training samples could alleviate population bias issue. While still improving the model’s overall performance considerably, we achieve a significant reduction (77.30%) in the model’s gender accuracy disparity.

Its spatial pattern depends on social, economic, political, and regional variables. Artificial intelligence has shown immense scope in analyzing the complexities and nuances of poverty. The proposed project aims to examine the poverty situation of rural India for the period of 1990-2022 based on the quality of life and livelihood indicators. The districts will be classified into ‘advanced’, ‘catching up’, ‘falling behind’, and ‘lagged’ regions. The project proposes to integrate multiple data sources, including conventional national-level large sample household surveys, census surveys, and proxy variables like daytime, and nighttime data from satellite images, and communication networks, to name a few, to provide a comprehensive view of poverty at the district level. The project also intends to examine causation and longitudinal analysis to examine the reasons for poverty. Poverty and inequality could be widening in developing countries due to demographic and growth-agglomerating policies. Therefore, targeting the lagging regions and the vulnerable population is essential to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life to achieve the goal of ‘zero poverty’.

For each stage (e.g., recall, pre-ranking, ranking, etc.) of a cascade RS, when a user triggers a request, we define two actions that determine the computation: (1) the trained instances of models with different computational complexity; and (2) the number of items to be inferred in the stage. We refer to the combinations of actions in all stages as action chains. A reward score is estimated for each action chain, followed by dynamic primal-dual optimization considering both the reward and computation budget.

Intuitively, having such explanations can educate and assist content moderators in interpreting and removing flagged hateful memes. This paper address this research gap by introducing Hateful meme with Reasons Dataset (HatReD), which is a new multimodal hateful meme dataset annotated with the underlying hateful contextual reasons. We also define a new conditional generation task that aims to automatically generate underlying reasons to explain hateful memes and establish the baseline performance of state-of-the-art pre-trained language models on this task.

It is mostly diagnosed at an advanced state causing high fatality rates, which highlights the importance of CRC early diagnosis. There are various methods used to enable early diagnosis of CRC, which are vital to increase survival rates such as colonoscopy. Recently, there are calls to start an early detection program in Egypt using colonoscopy. It can be used for diagnosis and prevention purposes to detect and remove polyps, which are benign growths that have the risk of turning into cancer. However, there tends to be a high miss rate of polyps from physicians, which motivates machine learning guided polyp segmentation methods in colonoscopy videos to aid physicians. To date, there are no large-scale video polyp segmentation dataset that is focused on African countries. It was shown in AI-assisted systems that under-served populations such as patients with African origin can be misdiagnosed. There is also a potential need in other African countries beyond Egypt to provide a cost efficient tool to record colonoscopy videos using smart phones without relying on video recording equipment. Since most of the equipment used in Africa are old and refurbished, and video recording equipment can get defective.

Specifically, we first model the problem of long-lasting humanitarian relief operations in conflict areas as an online multi-stage rescuer-and-attacker interdiction game in which aid demands are revealed in an online fashion. Both models of single-source and multiple-source relief supply policy are established respectively, and two corresponding near-optimal online algorithms are proposed. In conjunction with a real case of anti-Ebola practice in conflict areas of DR Congo, we find that 1) long-lasting humanitarian relief operations aiming alleviation of crises in conflict areas can lead to indirect funding of local rebel groups; 2) the operations can activate the rebel groups to some extent, as evidenced by the scope expansion of their activities.

We validate this approach in 18 languages’ BERT models and show that this framework is comparable to, if not better than, other heuristics with high training costs. In addition, given lightweight continued pre-training on limited data where available, this framework outperforms the original monolingual language models in six out of seven tested languages with up to 200x less pre-training. Aiming at the Leave No One Behind Principle (LNOB), our approach manages to reduce inequalities between languages and energy consumption greatly.

The widespread use of camera traps coupled with AI-based analysis tools serves as an excellent example of successful and non-invasive use of technology for design, planning, and evaluation of conservation policies. As opposed to the typical use of camera traps that capture still images or short videos, in this project, we propose to analyze longer term videos monitoring a large flock of birds. This project, which is part of the NSF-TIH Indo-US joint R\\&D partnership, will focus on solving challenges associated with the analysis of long-term videos captured at feeding grounds and nesting sites, among other such locations that host large flocks of migratory birds. We foresee that the objectives of this project would lead to datasets and benchmarking tools as well as novel algorithms that would be instrumental in developing automated video analysis tools that could in turn help understand individual and social behavior of birds. The first of the key outcomes of this project will include the curation of challenging, real-world datasets for benchmarking various image and video analytics algorithms for tasks such as counting, detection, segmentation, and tracking. Our recent efforts towards this outcome is a curated dataset of 812 high-resolution, point-annotated, images (4K – 32MP) of a flock of Demoiselle cranes (Anthropoides virgo) taken from their feeding site at Khichan, Rajasthan, India. The average number of birds in each image is about 207, with a maximum count of 1500. The benchmarking experiments using state-of-the-art vision techniques struggle with tasks such as segmentation, detection, localization, and density estimation for the proposed dataset. Over the execution of this open science project, we will be scaling this dataset for segmentation and tracking in videos, as well as developing novel techniques for video analytics for wildlife monitoring.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5851>>title": "Find Rhinos without Finding Rhinos: Active Learning with Multimodal Imagery of South African Rhino Habitats", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5851>>abstract": "Much of Earth’s charismatic megafauna is endangered by human activities, particularly the rhino, which is at risk of extinction due to the poaching crisis in Africa. Monitoring rhinos’ movement is crucial to their protection but has unfortunately proven difficult because rhinos are elusive. Therefore, instead of tracking rhinos, we propose the novel approach of mapping communal defecation sites, called middens, which give information about rhinos’ spatial behavior valuable to anti-poaching, management, and reintroduction efforts. This paper provides the first-ever mapping of rhino midden locations by building classifiers to detect them using remotely sensed thermal, RGB, and LiDAR imagery in passive and active learning settings. As existing active learning methods perform poorly due to the extreme class imbalance in our dataset, we design MultimodAL, an active learning system employing a ranking technique and multimodality to achieve competitive performance with passive learning models with 94% fewer labels. Our methods could therefore save over 76 hours in labeling time when used on a similarly-sized dataset. Unexpectedly, our midden map reveals that rhino middens are not randomly distributed throughout the landscape; rather, they are clustered. Consequently, rangers should be targeted at areas with high midden densities to strengthen anti-poaching efforts, in line with UN Target 15.7.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5859>>title": "For Women, Life, Freedom: Social Web Analyses of a Watershed Moment of Iran’s Gender Struggles", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI for Good>>AI4SG5859>>abstract": "In this paper, we present a computational analysis of the Persian Twitter discourse with the aim to estimate the shift in stance toward gender equality following the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.

However, maintaining long-term user engagement with fitness applications has proved a difficult task. Personalisation of the app recommendations that change over time can be a key factor for maintaining high user engagement. In this work we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework for recommending sequences of body-weight exercises to home users over a mobile application interface. The framework employs a user simulator, tuned to feedback a weighted sum of realistic workout rewards, and trains a neural network model to maximise the expected reward over generated exercise sequences.

However, this is typically not in the context of long audio recordings wherein the text being queried does not appear verbatim within the audio file. This work is a collaboration with a non-governmental organization called CARE India that collects long audio health surveys from young mothers residing in rural parts of Bihar, India. Given a question drawn from a questionnaire that is used to guide these surveys, we aim to locate where the question is asked within a long audio recording. This is of great value to African and Asian organizations that would otherwise have to painstakingly go through long and noisy audio recordings to locate questions (and answers) of interest. Our proposed framework, INDENT, uses a cross-attention-based model and prior information on the temporal ordering of sentences to learn speech embeddings that capture the semantics of the underlying spoken text. These learnt embeddings are used to retrieve the corresponding audio segment based on text queries at inference time. We empirically demonstrate the significant effectiveness (improvement in R-avg of about 3%) of our model over those obtained using text-based heuristics.  We also show how noisy ASR, generated using state-of-the-art ASR models for Indian languages, yields better results when used in place of speech.

A user, if happening to be exposed to strongly polarized content, might be steered towards more and more radicalized content by subsequent recommendations, eventually being trapped in what we call a \"radicalization pathway\". In this paper, we investigate how to mitigate radicalization pathways using a graph-based approach. We model the set of recommendations in a what-to-watch-next (W2W) recommender as a directed graph, where nodes correspond to content items, links to recommendations, and paths to possible user sessions. We measure the segregation score of a node representing radicalized content as the expected length of a random walk from that node to any node representing non-radicalized content. A high segregation score thus implies a larger chance of getting users trapped in radicalization pathways. We aim to reduce the prevalence of radicalization pathways by selecting a small number of edges to rewire, so as to minimize the maximum of segregation scores among all radicalized nodes while maintaining the relevance of recommendations. We propose an efficient yet effective greedy heuristic based on the absorbing random walk theory for the rewiring problem.

To implement an effective collaboration, the robot should be able to recognize the human’s intentions and guarantee safe and adaptive behavior along the intended motion directions. The robot-control strategies with such attributes are particularly demanded in the industrial field. Indeed, with this aim, this work proposes a Q-Learning-based Model Predictive Variable Impedance Control (Q-LMPVIC) to assist the operators in physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) tasks. A Cartesian impedance control loop is designed to implement decoupled compliant robot dynamics. The impedance control parameters (i.e., setpoint and damping parameters) are then optimized online in order to maximize the performance of the pHRC. For this purpose, an ensemble of neural networks is designed to learn the modeling of the human-robot interaction dynamics while capturing the associated uncertainties. The derived modeling is then exploited by the model predictive controller (MPC), enhanced with stability guarantees by means of Lyapunov constraints. The MPC is solved by making use of a Q-Learning method that, in its online implementation, uses an actor-critic algorithm to approximate the exact solution. Indeed, the Q-learning method provides an accurate and highly efficient solution (in terms of computational time and resources).

In this paper, we explore the automatic recognition of these functions. To do so, we propose to adapt existing approaches to dialog act recognition, so that they can deal with the hierarchical classification problem. More specifically, we propose the use of an end-to-end hierarchical network with cascading outputs and maximum a posteriori path estimation to predict the communicative function at each level of the hierarchy, preserve the dependencies between the functions in the path, and decide at which level to stop. Additionally, we rely on transfer learning processes to address the data scarcity problem.

A second issue is that while EFGs have recently seen significant algorithmic progress, their classical formalization is unsuitable for efficient presentation of the underlying ideas, such as those around decomposition.\nTo solve the first issue, we introduce factored-observation stochastic games (FOSGs), a minor modification of the POSG formalism which distinguishes between private and public observation and thereby greatly simplifies decomposition. To remedy the second issue, we show that FOSGs and POSGs are naturally connected to EFGs: by \"unrolling\" a FOSG into its tree form, we obtain an EFG. Conversely, any perfect-recall timeable EFG corresponds to some underlying FOSG in this manner. Moreover, this relationship justifies several minor modifications to the classical EFG formalization that recently appeared as an implicit response to the model’s issues with decomposition.

An interesting question that arises is how to best use such approaches as advisors to help improve reinforcement learning in multi-agent domains. We provide a principled framework for incorporating action recommendations from online sub-optimal advisors in multi-agent settings.

Reinforcement learning is expensive to train and often struggles to achieve coordination among a large fleet. This paper designs a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of the two while overcoming their drawbacks. Specifically, it trains an optimization proxy, i.e., a machine-learning model that approximates an optimization model, and refines the proxy with reinforcement learning. This Reinforcement Learning from Optimization Proxy (RLOP) approach is efficient to train and deploy, and achieves better results than RL or optimization alone.

This paper aims at optimizing the mean-semivariance (MSV) criterion in reinforcement learning w.r.t. steady reward distribution. Since semivariance is time-inconsistent and does not satisfy the standard Bellman equation, the traditional dynamic programming methods are inapplicable to MSV problems directly. To tackle this challenge, we resort to Perturbation Analysis (PA) theory and establish the performance difference formula for MSV. We reveal that the MSV problem can be solved by iteratively solving a sequence of RL problems with a policy-dependent reward function.

Unfortunately, computing a trajectory that satisfies mission goals while constraining the probability of failure is difficult because of the need to reason about complex, multidimensional probability distributions.  Recent methods have seen success using chance-constrained, model-based planning.  We argue there are two main drawbacks to these approaches.  First, current methods suffer from an inability to deal with expressive environment models such as 3D non-convex obstacles.  Second, most planners rely on considerable simplifications when computing trajectory risk including approximating the agent’s dynamics, geometry, and uncertainty.  We apply hybrid search to the risk-bound, goal-directed planning problem.  The hybrid search consists of a region planner and a trajectory planner.  The region planner makes discrete choices by reasoning about geometric regions that the agent should visit in order to accomplish its mission.  In formulating the region planner, we propose landmark regions that help produce obstacle-free paths.  The region planner passes paths through the environment to a trajectory planner; the task of the trajectory planner is to optimize trajectories that respect the agent’s dynamics and the user’s desired risk of mission failure.  We discuss three approaches to modeling trajectory risk: a CDF-based approach, a sampling-based collocation method, and an algorithm named Shooting Method Monte Carlo.  A variety of 2D and 3D test cases are presented in the full paper including a linear case, a Dubins car model, and an underwater autonomous vehicle.

However, there is a lack of common criteria for objective artistic evaluation both of human and AI creations. This is a frequent issue in the field of dance, where different performance metrics focus either on evaluating human or computational skills separately. This work proposes a methodological approach for the artistic evaluation of both AI and human artistic creations in the field of robotic dance. First, we define a series of common initial constraints to create robotic dance choreographies in a balanced initial setting, in collaboration with a group of human dancers and choreographer. Then, we compare both creation processes through a human audience evaluation. Finally, we investigate which choreography aspects (e.g., the music genre) have the largest impact on the evaluation, and we provide useful guidelines and future research directions for the analysis of interconnections between AI and human dance creation.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5605>>title": "The ACCompanion: Combining Reactivity, Robustness, and Musical Expressivity in an Automatic Piano Accompanist", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5605>>abstract": "This paper introduces the ACCompanion, an expressive accompaniment system. Similarly to a musician who accompanies a soloist playing a given musical piece, our system can produce a human-like rendition of the accompaniment part that follows the soloist’s choices in terms of tempo, dynamics, and articulation. The ACCompanion works in the symbolic domain, i.e., it needs a musical instrument capable of producing and playing MIDI data, with explicitly encoded onset, offset, and pitch for each played note. We describe the components that go into such a system, from real-time score following and prediction to expressive performance generation and online adaptation to the expressive choices of the human player. Based on our experience with repeated live demonstrations in front of various audiences, we offer an analysis of the challenges of combining these components into a system that is highly reactive and precise, while still a reliable musical partner, robust to possible performance errors and responsive to expressive variations.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5607>>title": "Discrete Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Symbolic Music Generation", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5607>>abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have made great strides in generating high-quality samples in both discrete and continuous domains.\nHowever, Discrete DDPMs (D3PMs) have yet to be applied to the domain of Symbolic Music.\nThis work presents the direct generation of Polyphonic Symbolic Music using D3PMs.\nOur model exhibits state-of-the-art sample quality, according to current quantitative evaluation metrics, and allows for flexible infilling at the note level.\nWe further show, that our models are accessible to post-hoc classifier guidance, widening the scope of possible applications.\nHowever, we also cast a critical view on quantitative evaluation of music sample quality via statistical metrics, and present a simple algorithm that can confound our metrics with completely spurious, non-musical samples.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5652>>title": "Q&A: Query-Based Representation Learning for Multi-Track Symbolic Music re-Arrangement", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5652>>abstract": "Music rearrangement is a common music practice of reconstructing and reconceptualizing a piece using new composition or instrumentation styles, which is also an important task of automatic music generation. Existing studies typically model the mapping from a source piece to a target piece via supervised learning. In this paper, we tackle rearrangement problems via self-supervised learning, in which the mapping styles can be regarded as conditions and controlled in a flexible way. Specifically, we are inspired by the representation disentanglement idea and propose Q&A, a query-based algorithm for multi-track music rearrangement under an encoder-decoder framework. Q&A learns both a content representation from the mixture and function (style) representations from each individual track, while the latter queries the former in order to rearrange a new piece. Our current model focuses on popular music and provides a controllable pathway to four scenarios: 1) re-instrumentation, 2) piano cover generation, 3) orchestration, and 4) voice separation. Experiments show that our query system achieves high-quality rearrangement results with delicate multi-track structures, significantly outperforming the baselines.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5672>>title": "Graph-based Polyphonic Multitrack Music Generation", "IJCAI2023>>program>>Special Track on AI, the Arts and Creativity>>ARTS5672>>abstract": "Graphs can be leveraged to model polyphonic multitrack symbolic music, where notes, chords and entire sections may be linked at different levels of the musical hierarchy by tonal and rhythmic relationships. Nonetheless, there is a lack of works that consider graph representations in the context of deep learning systems for music generation. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel graph representation for music and a deep Variational Autoencoder that generates the structure and the content of musical graphs separately, one after the other, with a hierarchical architecture that matches the structural priors of music. By separating the structure and content of musical graphs, it is possible to condition generation by specifying which instruments are played at certain times. This opens the door to a new form of human-computer interaction in the context of music co-creation. After training the model on existing MIDI datasets, the experiments show that the model is able to generate appealing short and long musical sequences and to realistically interpolate between them, producing music that is tonally and rhythmically consistent. Finally, the visualization of the embeddings shows that the model is able to organize its latent space in accordance with known musical concepts.", "IJCAI2023>>program>>IJCAI Awards>>IJCAI-23 Awards Announcement>>IJCAI-23 Awards Announcement_2": "The IJCAI Awards Selection Committee receives advice from members of the IJCAI-23 Awards Review Committee, who comment on the accuracy of the nomination material and provide additional information about the nominees.

But, detection of intention dynamics from text or voice, especially in the Indian multilingual contexts, is a challenging task. So, my first research question is on intent detection and then I work on the application in Indian Multilingual Healthcare scenario. Speech dialogue systems are designed by a pre-defined set of intents to perform user specified tasks. Newer intentions may surface\nover time that call for retraining. However, the newer intents may not be explicitly announced and need to be inferred dynamically.\nHence, here are two crucial jobs: (a) recognizing newly emergent intents; and (b) annotating the data of the new intents in order\nto effectively retrain the underlying classifier. The tasks become specially challenging when a large number of new intents emerge\nsimultaneously and there is a limited budget of manual annotation. We develop MNID (Multiple Novel Intent Detection), a cluster\nbased framework that can identify multiple novel intents while optimized human annotation cost. Empirical findings on numerous\nbenchmark datasets (of varying sizes) show that MNID surpasses the baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and F1-score by wisely allocating the budget for annotation. We apply intent detection approach on different domains in Indian multilingual scenarios –\nhealthcare, finance etc. The creation of advanced NLU healthcare systems is threatened by the lack of data and technology constraints for resource-poor languages in developing nations like India.

However, two key challenges face real-world sequential decision making: the need for adaptable models and the need for safety during both learning and execution. Adaptability refers to the ability of a model to quickly adapt to new and diverse environments, which is especially challenging in environments where feedback is sparse. To address this challenge, we propose using meta reinforcement learning with sub-optimal demonstration data. Safety is also critical in real-world sequential decision making. A model that adheres to safety requirements can avoid dangerous outcomes and ensure the safety of humans and other agents in the environment. We propose an approach based on online convex optimization that ensures safety at every time step.

However, while variants of attention-based GNNs are setting new benchmarks for numerous real-world datasets, recent works have pointed out that their induced attentions are less robust and generalizable against noisy graphs due to lack of direct supervision. In this paper, we present a new framework which utilizes the tool of causality to provide a powerful supervision signal for the learning process of attention functions. Specifically, we estimate the direct causal effect of attention to the final prediction, and then maximize such effect to guide attention attending to more meaningful neighbors. Our method can serve as a plug-and-play module for any canonical attention-based GNNs in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on a wide range of real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Submission site opening": "January 4, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Abstract submission deadline": "January 11, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Author information deadline": "January 16, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Full paper submission deadline": "January 18, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Appendix and resubmission information deadline": ": January 23, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Summary reject notification": "February 24, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Author response period": "March 20-23, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_1>>ImportantDates (all times are Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)>>Paper notification": "April 19, 2023", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_6>>Contact for questions not answered in the call>>Contact for questions not answered in the call_1": ":pcchair@ijcai-23.org", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_6>>Contact for questions not answered in the call>>Contact for questions not answered in the call_2": "pcchair@ijcai-23.org", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_7>>New in 2023>>Page limit:": "papers must be no longer than9pages in total:7pages for the body of the paper and2pages for references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages.  For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and the contribution statement.", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_7>>New in 2023>>Authors commit to reviewing:": "by submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2023 and may be asked to review papers for the conference.

Existing numeric planning systems for the problem often discretize numeric variables or impose convex constraints on numeric variables, which harms the performance when solving problems, especially when the problems contain obstacles and non-linear numeric effects. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm framework to solve numeric planning problems mixed with logical relations and numeric changes based on gradient descent. We cast the numeric planning with logical relations and numeric changes as an optimization problem. Specifically, we extend the syntax to allow parameters of action models to be either objects or real-valued numbers, which enhances the ability to model real-world numeric effects. Based on the extended modeling language, we propose a gradient-based framework to solve the numeric planning problem. We also propose a novel algorithm to compute the gradient of the objective function. We evaluate our approach on a set of benchmark problems and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art numeric planning systems.", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call for IJCAI 2023 Doctoral Consortium Program>>Call for IJCAI 2023 Doctoral Consortium Program_4>>Application and Submission Instructions>>Application and Submission Instructions_2": "In particular, please distinguish your research from the current state-of-the-art (e.g., related work), including explaining and discussing existing limitations, novelties in your approaches, and the soundness of your approaches.", "IJCAI2023>>calls>>Call for IJCAI 2023 Doctoral Consortium Program>>Call for IJCAI 2023 Doctoral Consortium Program_4>>Application and Submission Instructions>>Application and Submission Instructions_3": "Moreover, it is important to highlight why you think the proposed approaches have the potential to address your research challenges (e.g., mentioning your prior studies and experiences).
