Working towards ethical and transparent automated content moderation (ACM), my goal is to find where it is still relevant to implement linguistic expertise. I show that transparent statistical models based on linguistic knowledge can still be competitive, while linguistic features have many other useful applications.\n\nQuestion:How can I inquire about questions regarding registration process and local arrangements?\nAnswer:", "gt": "For questions regarding registration process get in touch with registration@ijcai.org.

In this paper, we describe recent works on WFOMC and the related problem of weighted first-order model sampling (WFOMS). We also discuss possible applications of WFOMC and WFOMS within statistical relational learning and beyond, e.g., automated solving of problems from enumerative combinatorics and elementary probability theory. Finally, we mention research problems that still need to be tackled in order to make applications of these methods really practical more broadly.\n\nIJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>1476>>title>>Multi-objective Optimization-based Selection for Quality-Diversity by Non-surrounded-dominated Sorting\n\nIJCAI2023>>program>>Survey Track>>SV5550>>title>>Complexity Results and Exact Algorithms for Fair Division of Indivisible Items: A Survey\n\nQuestion:How many options are there if divide the registration type according to the time period?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The attendees have three registration options depending on the timeframe: Early registration, Late registration, and Onsite registration.", "response": "Based on the given context, there is not enough information to determine the number of options for dividing the registration type according to the time period."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "How many different types of fees are available for payment at this conference?", "retrieve_results": {"IJCAI2023>>committees>>PC Member List>>PC Member List_495>>Affiliation>>Washington University in St Louis": 0.20145809650421143, "IJCAI2023>>committees>>PC Member List>>PC Member List_2006>>Affiliation>>Washington University in St Louis": 0.20155692100524902, "IJCAI2023>>committees>>PC Member List>>PC Member List_1264>>Affiliation>>Washington University in St Louis": 0.2056930661201477, "IJCAI2023>>committees>>PC Member List>>PC Member List_1374>>Affiliation>>Central Connecticut State University": 0.21008414030075073, "IJCAI2023>>committees>>PC Member List>>PC Member List_1981>>Affiliation>>Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis": 0.21037054061889648}, "from": "IJCAI 2023/attending/Registration Information/Fees", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
