First, the extension continuity-aware attention module is designed to construct hierarchical attention specifically for neuron extensibility and slice continuity, allowing the transformer to learn instance voxel semantic context from a global perspective while using continuity priors to enhance voxel spatial awareness. Second, the appearance prompt modulator plays a crucial role in leveraging voxel-adaptive appearance knowledge conditioned on affinity rich in spatial information to guide instance voxel semantics, therefore maximizing the potential of affinity learning to supplement metric learning. The paper demonstrates that APViT provides consistent improvements across multiple challenging benchmark tests, combined with a high degree of flexibility under the same post-processing strategy."}, {"query": "What is the abstract of the paper with the ID 1009?", "output": "The scarcity of labeled data is a long-standing challenge for many machine learning tasks.

To perform the gradient flow of distributions on the curved feature-Gaussian space, they unravel the Riemannian structure of the space and compute explicitly the Riemannian gradient of the loss function induced by the optimal transport metric. For practical applications, they also propose a discretized flow, and provide conditional results guaranteeing the global convergence of the flow to the optimum. Lastly, they illustrate the results of their proposed gradient flow method on several real-world datasets and show that their method can improve the accuracy of classification models in transfer learning settings."}, {"query": "What is the abstract of the paper titled 'Less Learn Shortcut: Analyzing and Mitigating Learning of Spurious Feature-Label Correlation'?", "output": "Recent research has revealed that deep neural networks often take dataset biases as a shortcut to make decisions rather than understand tasks, leading to failures in real-world applications. In this study, we focus on the spurious correlation between word features and labels that models learn from the biased data distribution of training data. In particular, we define the word highly co-occurring with a specific label as biased word, and the example containing biased word as biased example. Our analysis shows that biased examples are easier for models to learn, while at the time of prediction, biased words make a significantly higher contribution to the models’ predictions, and models tend to assign predicted labels over-relying on the spurious correlation between words and labels. To mitigate models’ over-reliance on the shortcut (i.e. spurious correlation), we propose a training strategy Less-Learn-Shortcut (LLS): our strategy quantifies the biased degree of the biased examples and down-weights them accordingly. Experimental results on Question Matching, Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks show that LLS is a task-agnostic strategy and can improve the model performance on adversarial data while maintaining good performance on in-domain data."}, {"query": "What is the abstract of the research 'Adaptive Path-Memory Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning' presented at IJCAI2023?", "output": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict the future missing facts based on historical information and has gained increasing research interest recently. Lots of works have been made to model the historical structural and temporal characteristics for the reasoning task. Most existing works model the graph structure mainly depending on entity representation. However, the magnitude of TKG entities in real-world scenarios is considerable, and an increasing number of new entities will arise as time goes on. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture modeling with relation feature of TKG, namely aDAptivE path-MemOry Network (DaeMon), which adaptively models the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate across history time. It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains substantial performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 4.8% absolute in MRR."}]
