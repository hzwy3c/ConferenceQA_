The submission is then reviewed by a panel of experts in a blind process, meaning the reviewers do not know the identity of the authors.\n\nIf the paper is accepted, authors may need to revise their work based on reviewers' comments and pay a registration fee to participate in the conference. Note that some conferences also request that at least one author present the paper at the conference.\n\nFor the most accurate information, authors should check the official IJCAI conference website or contact the conference organizers."}]
