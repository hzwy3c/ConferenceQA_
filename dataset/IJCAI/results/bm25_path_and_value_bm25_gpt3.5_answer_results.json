In contrast, this question is not at all understood for multi-objective optimization.\n\n In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) on a classic benchmark in the presence of noise in the objective function. \n We prove that when bit-wise prior noise with rate p <= alpha/n, alpha a suitable constant, is present, the simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (SEMO) without any adjustments to cope with noise finds the Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark in time O(n^2 log n), just as in the case without noise. Given that the problem here is to arrive at a population consisting of n+1 individuals witnessing the Pareto front, this is a surprisingly strong robustness to noise (comparably simple evolutionary algorithms cannot optimize the single-objective OneMax problem in polynomial time when p = omega(log(n)/n)).

Chan et al. [IJCAI 2019] proposed a new fairness notion, maximin-awareness (MMA), which guarantees that every agent is not the worst-off one, no matter how the items that are not allocated to her are distributed. We adapt and generalize this notion to the case of indivisible chores and when the agents may have arbitrary weights. Due to the inherent difficulty of MMA, we also consider its up to one and up to any relaxations. A string of results on the existence and computation of MMA related fair allocations, and their connections to existing fairness concepts are given.\n\nIJCAI2023>>calls>>Call for IJCAI 2023 Doctoral Consortium Program>>Call for IJCAI 2023 Doctoral Consortium Program_4>>Application and Submission Instructions>>Application and Submission Instructions_3>>Moreover, it is important to highlight why you think the proposed approaches have the potential to address your research challenges (e.g., mentioning your prior studies and experiences).

However, Gibbs entropy is sensitive to prediction errors, and thus, self-training tends to fail when the domain shift is large. In this paper, we propose Meta-Tsallis Entropy minimization (MTEM). MTEM uses an instance adaptive Tsallis entropy to replace the Gibbs entropy and a meta-learning algorithm to optimize the instance adaptive Tsallis entropy on the target domain. To reduce the computation cost of MTEM, we propose an approximation technique to approximate the second-order derivation involved in the meta-learning. To efficiently generate pseudo labels, we propose an annealing sampling mechanism for exploring the model’s prediction probability.

However, Gibbs entropy is sensitive to prediction errors, and thus, self-training tends to fail when the domain shift is large. In this paper, we propose Meta-Tsallis Entropy minimization (MTEM). MTEM uses an instance adaptive Tsallis entropy to replace the Gibbs entropy and a meta-learning algorithm to optimize the instance adaptive Tsallis entropy on the target domain. To reduce the computation cost of MTEM, we propose an approximation technique to approximate the second-order derivation involved in the meta-learning. To efficiently generate pseudo labels, we propose an annealing sampling mechanism for exploring the model’s prediction probability. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the meta-learning algorithm in MTEM and analyze the effectiveness of MTEM in achieving domain adaptation. Experimentally, MTEM improves the adaptation performance of BERT with an average of 4 percent on the benchmark dataset.\n\nIJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Demos>>Call For Demos_9>>Submission Requirements>>Submission Requirements_6>>Ethics statement:>>Ethics statement:_1>>An optional ethics statement is encouraged to be included in the submission.
