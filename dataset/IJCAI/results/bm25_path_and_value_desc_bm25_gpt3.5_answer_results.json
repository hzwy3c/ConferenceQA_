While software such as ChatGPT has recently revolutionized certain areas of AI, athletic intelligence on real robotic systems seems to still be elusive in the AI community. To have better robots in the future which can perform a wide variety of dynamic tasks in uncertain environments, the physical or athletic intelligence of robots has to be improved. However, this is quite challenging since the fields of robotics and reinforcement learning (RL) lack standardized bench marking tasks on real hardware. To facilitate reproducibility and to stimulate algorithmic advancements, the AI Olympics competition is being held at IJCAI 2023 based on the RealAIGym project. The challenge will involve two stages: simulation and real-robot experiments where teams (and their agents) can compete to get the highest score on our leader boards and win some cool prizes! We invite people from all communities (AI, ML, RL, Optimal Control, Heuristics, or any combination of these approaches) to try this competition and submit their best efforts (in form of 2-4 page paper with accompanying code) in achieving very standard dynamic task (i.e. swingup and upright stabilization) on a canonical underactuated system known as acrobot or pendubot (double pendulum with single actuator).": 0}, "from": "IJCAI 2023/calls/Call For Papers/6/New in 2023/Page limit:", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

There is also a question on the ownership of text snippets, images or any media sampled from these generative models: which one of these owns it, a user of the generative model, a developer who trained the model, or content creators who produced training examples? It is certain that these questions, and many more, will be answered over time, as these large-scale generative models are more widely adopted. However, we do not yet have any clear answers to any of these questions.\n\nIJCAI2023>>calls>>Call For Papers>>Call For Papers_7>>New in 2023>>Separate deadline for technical appendix and resubmission information:>>the authors are given five extra days after the submission deadline to update their technical appendix and resubmission information.\n\nIJCAI2023>>program>>Competitions and Challenges>>Competitions and Challenges_7>>Description>>As artificial intelligence (AI) gains new capabilities, it becomes important to evaluate it on real-world tasks. While software such as ChatGPT has recently revolutionized certain areas of AI, athletic intelligence on real robotic systems seems to still be elusive in the AI community. To have better robots in the future which can perform a wide variety of dynamic tasks in uncertain environments, the physical or athletic intelligence of robots has to be improved. However, this is quite challenging since the fields of robotics and reinforcement learning (RL) lack standardized bench marking tasks on real hardware. To facilitate reproducibility and to stimulate algorithmic advancements, the AI Olympics competition is being held at IJCAI 2023 based on the RealAIGym project. The challenge will involve two stages: simulation and real-robot experiments where teams (and their agents) can compete to get the highest score on our leader boards and win some cool prizes! We invite people from all communities (AI, ML, RL, Optimal Control, Heuristics, or any combination of these approaches) to try this competition and submit their best efforts (in form of 2-4 page paper with accompanying code) in achieving very standard dynamic task (i.e. swingup and upright stabilization) on a canonical underactuated system known as acrobot or pendubot (double pendulum with single actuator).\n\nQuestion:Is there any page limit of the papers?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Papers must be no longer than9pages in total:7pages for the body of the paper and2pages for references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages.

The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MolHF first generates bonds through a multi-scale architecture, then generates atoms based on the coarsened graph structure at each scale. We demonstrate that MolHF achieves state-of-the-art performance in random generation and property optimization, implying its high capacity to model data distribution. Furthermore, MolHF is the first flow-based model that can be applied to model larger molecules (polymer) with more than 100 heavy atoms.

Significant progress has been made by resorting to generative models for graphs. However, limited attention is paid to hierarchical generative models, which can exploit the inherent hierarchical structure (with rich semantic information) of the molecular graphs and generate complex molecules of larger size that we shall demonstrate to be difficult for most existing models. The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MolHF first generates bonds through a multi-scale architecture, then generates atoms based on the coarsened graph structure at each scale. We demonstrate that MolHF achieves state-of-the-art performance in random generation and property optimization, implying its high capacity to model data distribution. Furthermore, MolHF is the first flow-based model that can be applied to model larger molecules (polymer) with more than 100 heavy atoms. The code and models are available at https://github.com/violet-sto/MolHF.\n\nIJCAI2023>>program>>Main Track>>2338>>title>>CSGCL: Community-Strength-Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning\n\nQuestion:How many presentations in the Main Track are related to knowledge graph at this conference?\nAnswer:", "gt": "There are 10 presentations in the Main Track related to knowledge graph at this conference.", "response": "Based on the given context, there is no information provided about the number of presentations in the Main Track that are related to knowledge graph at this conference."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "How many presentations in the Main Track are related to graph neural network(GNN) at this conference?", "retrieve_results": {"IJCAI2023>>program>>Survey Track>>SV5484>>title>>Graph Pooling for Graph Neural Networks: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities": 0, "IJCAI2023>>program>>Survey Track>>SV5484>>abstract>>Graph neural networks have emerged as a leading architecture for many graph-level tasks, such as graph classification and graph generation.
