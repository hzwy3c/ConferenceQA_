(As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) Authors are also required not to submit their papers to venues with formally published proceedings during the  IJCAI 2023 review period.

Papers need to be electronically submitted via the provided Microsoft site. Titles, author details, and brief abstracts are mandatory and can have minor changes until the full paper submission deadline. All co-authors should register and provide details to manage conflicts during reviews. Each author can submit up to 8 papers.

Since triples are not canonicalized, previous methods either focus on canonicalizing noun phrases (NPs) to reduce graph sparsity, or utilize textual forms to improve type compatibility. However, they neglect to canonicalize relation phrases (RPs) and triples, making OpenKG maintain high sparsity and impeding the performance. To address the above issues, we propose a Canonicalization-Enhanced Known Fact-Aware (CEKFA) framework that boosts link prediction performance through sparsity reduction of RPs and triples. First, we propose a similarity-driven RP canonicalization method to reduce RPs’ sparsity by sharing knowledge of semantically similar ones. Second, to reduce the sparsity of triples, a known fact-aware triple canonicalization method is designed to retrieve relevant known facts from training data. Finally, these two types of canonical information are integrated into a general two-stage re-ranking framework that can be applied to most existing knowledge graph embedding methods. Experiment results on two OpenKG datasets, ReVerb20K and ReVerb45K, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.

Since triples are not canonicalized, previous methods either focus on canonicalizing noun phrases (NPs) to reduce graph sparsity, or utilize textual forms to improve type compatibility. However, they neglect to canonicalize relation phrases (RPs) and triples, making OpenKG maintain high sparsity and impeding the performance. To address the above issues, we propose a Canonicalization-Enhanced Known Fact-Aware (CEKFA) framework that boosts link prediction performance through sparsity reduction of RPs and triples. First, we propose a similarity-driven RP canonicalization method to reduce RPs’ sparsity by sharing knowledge of semantically similar ones. Second, to reduce the sparsity of triples, a known fact-aware triple canonicalization method is designed to retrieve relevant known facts from training data. Finally, these two types of canonical information are integrated into a general two-stage re-ranking framework that can be applied to most existing knowledge graph embedding methods. Experiment results on two OpenKG datasets, ReVerb20K and ReVerb45K, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results. Extensive experimental analyses illustrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed framework.\n\nQuestion:Are there any workshops related to knowledge graph?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes, their titles are “The 1st International Workshop on Knowledge-Based Compositional Generalization (KBCG)”, “Knowledge Discovery from Healthcare Data VI”", "response": "There are many workshops related to knowledge graph.
