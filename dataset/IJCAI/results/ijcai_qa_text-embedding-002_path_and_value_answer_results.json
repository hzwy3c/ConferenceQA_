Lots of works have been made to model the historical structural and temporal characteristics for the reasoning task. Most existing works model the graph structure mainly depending on entity representation. However, the magnitude of TKG entities in real-world scenarios is considerable, and an increasing number of new entities will arise as time goes on. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture modeling with relation feature of TKG, namely aDAptivE path-MemOry Network (DaeMon), which adaptively models the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate across history time. It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains substantial performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 4.8% absolute in MRR."}, {"query": "What is the abstract of the paper titled 'Less Learn Shortcut: Analyzing and Mitigating Learning of Spurious Feature-Label Correlation'?", "output": "Recent research has revealed that deep neural networks often take dataset biases as a shortcut to make decisions rather than understand tasks, leading to failures in real-world applications. In this study, we focus on the spurious correlation between word features and labels that models learn from the biased data distribution of training data. In particular, we define the word highly co-occurring with a specific label as biased word, and the example containing biased word as biased example. Our analysis shows that biased examples are easier for models to learn, while at the time of prediction, biased words make a significantly higher contribution to the models’ predictions, and models tend to assign predicted labels over-relying on the spurious correlation between words and labels. To mitigate models’ over-reliance on the shortcut (i.e. spurious correlation), we propose a training strategy Less-Learn-Shortcut (LLS): our strategy quantifies the biased degree of the biased examples and down-weights them accordingly. Experimental results on Question Matching, Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks show that LLS is a task-agnostic strategy and can improve the model performance on adversarial data while maintaining good performance on in-domain data."}]
