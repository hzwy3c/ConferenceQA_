Due to the unstructured and irregular nature of 3D object data, it is usually difficult to obtain high-quality surface details and geometry textures via a low-cost hardware setup. In this paper, we establish a multimodal-driven variational autoencoder (mmVAE) framework to perform 3D surface enhancement based on 2D normal images. To fully leverage the multimodal learning, we investigate a multimodal Gaussian mixture model (mmGMM) to align and fuse the latent feature representations from different modalities, and further propose a cross-scale encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct high-resolution normal images. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method delivers promising surface geometry structures and details in comparison with competitive advances.",

We lift both datasets to the space of probability distributions on the feature-Gaussian manifold, and then develop a gradient flow method that minimizes the maximum mean discrepancy loss. To perform the gradient flow of distributions on the curved feature-Gaussian space, we unravel the Riemannian structure of the space and compute explicitly the  Riemannian gradient of the loss function induced by the optimal transport metric. For practical applications, we also propose a discretized flow, and provide conditional results guaranteeing the global convergence of the flow to the optimum. We illustrate the results of our proposed gradient flow method on several real-world datasets and show our method can improve the accuracy of classification models in transfer learning settings.",

        "answer": "Actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have recently achieved prominent success in tackling various challenging reinforcement learning (RL) problems, particularly complex control tasks with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Nevertheless, existing research showed that actor-critic DRL algorithms often failed to explore their learning environments effectively, resulting in limited learning stability and performance. To address this limitation, several ensemble DRL algorithms have been proposed lately to boost exploration and stabilize the learning process. However, most of existing ensemble algorithms do not explicitly train all base learners towards jointly optimizing the performance of the ensemble. In this paper, we propose a new technique to train an ensemble of base learners based on an innovative multi-step integration method. This training technique enables us to develop a new hierarchical learning algorithm for ensemble DRL that effectively promotes inter-learner collaboration through stable inter-learner parameter sharing. The design of our new algorithm is verified theoretically. The algorithm is also shown empirically to outperform several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms on multiple benchmark RL problems.",

And we have to allocate the items (i.e., the vertices of the graph) to a set of agents in such a way that (a) the allocation is fair (for appropriate notions of fairness) and (b) each agent receives a bundle of items (i.e., a subset of vertices) that induces a subgraph with a specific “nice structure.” This model has previously been studied in the literature with the nice structure being a connected subgraph. In this paper, we propose an alternative for connectivity in fair division. We introduce compact graphs, and look for fair allocations in which each agent receives a compact bundle of items. Through compactness, we attempt to capture the idea that every agent must receive a bundle of “closely related” items. We prove a host of hardness and tractability results with respect to fairness concepts such as proportionality, envy-freeness and maximin share guarantee.",

We assume that\nwe have both an abstract and a concrete nondeterministic basic action theory, and a refinement mapping which  specifies how abstract actions, decomposed into agent actions and environment reactions, are implemented by concrete ConGolog programs. This new setting supports strategic reasoning and strategy synthesis, by allowing us to quantify separately on agent actions and environment reactions. We show that if the agent has a (strong FOND) plan/strategy to achieve a goal/complete a task at the abstract level, and it can always execute the nondeterministic abstract actions to completion at the concrete level, then there exist a refinement of it that is a (strong FOND) plan/strategy to achieve the refinement of the goal/task at the concrete level.",

        "answer": "Recent research has revealed that deep neural networks often take dataset biases as a shortcut to make decisions rather than understand tasks, leading to failures in real-world applications. In this study, we focus on the spurious correlation between word features and labels that models learn from the biased data distribution of training data. In particular, we define the word highly co-occurring with a specific label as biased word, and the example containing biased word as biased example. Our analysis shows that biased examples are easier for models to learn, while at the time of prediction, biased words make a significantly higher contribution to the models’ predictions, and models tend to assign predicted labels over-relying on the spurious correlation between words and labels. To mitigate models’ over-reliance on the shortcut (i.e. spurious correlation), we propose a training strategy Less-Learn-Shortcut (LLS): our strategy quantifies the biased degree of the biased examples and down-weights them accordingly. Experimental results on Question Matching, Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks show that LLS is a task-agnostic strategy and can improve the model performance on adversarial data while maintaining good performance on in-domain data.",

        "answer": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict the future missing facts based on historical information and has gained increasing research interest recently. Lots of works have been made to model the historical structural and temporal characteristics for the reasoning task. Most existing works model the graph structure mainly depending on entity representation. However, the magnitude of TKG entities in real-world scenarios is considerable, and an increasing number of new entities will arise as time goes on. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture modeling with relation feature of TKG, namely aDAptivE path-MemOry Network (DaeMon), which adaptively models the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate across history time. It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains substantial performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 4.8% absolute in MRR.",
