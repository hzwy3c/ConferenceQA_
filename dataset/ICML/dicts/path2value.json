The proposed formulation shows that a joint generator model can be trained from two directions: a conditional discriminator and an un-conditional discriminator with a classifier. They combine the formulation of these two routes and propose a new method called Energy-based cGAN (ECGAN). ECGAN shows how to use a classifier for cGANs, and it explains other variants of cGANs such as ContraGAN, ACGAN, and ProjGAN as variations of its framework.

However, the black-box characteristics of the existing ML approach inevitably lead to less interpretability and verifiability in making clinical predictions. To enhance the interpretability of medical intelligence, it becomes critical to develop methodologies to explain predictions as these systems are pervasively being introduced to the healthcare domain, which requires a higher level of safety and security. Such methodologies would make medical decisions more trustworthy and reliable for physicians, which could ultimately facilitate the deployment. In addition, it is essential to develop more interpretable and transparent ML systems. For instance, by exploiting structured knowledge or prior clinical information, one can design models to learn aspects more aligned with clinical reasoning. Also, it may help mitigate biases in the learning process, or identify more relevant variables for making medical decisions.In this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers in ML, computer vision, healthcare, medicine, NLP, public health, computational biology, biomedical informatics, and clinical fields to facilitate discussions including related challenges, definition, formalisms, and evaluation protocols regarding interpretable medical machine intelligence. Our workshop will be in a large-attendance talk format. The expected number of attendees is about 150. The workshop appeals to ICML audiences as interpretability is a major challenge to deploy ML in critical domains such as healthcare. By providing a platform that fosters potential collaborations and discussions between attendees, we hope the workshop is fruitful in offering a step toward building autonomous clinical decision systems with a higher-level understanding of interpretability.", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_2>>time": "Sat Jul 29 03:00 AM -- 11:00 AM (CST)", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_2>>location": " Ballroom A None", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_2>>workshop": "2nd ICML Workshop on New Frontiers in Adversarial Machine Learning", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_2>>content": "Given the success of AdvML-inspired research, we propose a new edition from our workshop at ICML’22 (AdvML-Frontiers’22), ‘The 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in AdvML’ (AdvML-Frontiers’23).

Scientifically, we aim to identify the challenges and limitations of current AdvML methods and explore new prospective and constructive views for next-generation AdvML across the full theory/algorithm/application stack. As the sequel to AdvML-Frontiers’22, we will continue exploring the new frontiers of AdvML in theoretical understanding, scalable algorithm and system designs, and scientific development that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. We will also add new features and programs in 2023. First, we will expand existing research themes, particularly considering the popularity of large foundational models (e.g., DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and ChatGPT). Examples of topics include AdvML for prompt learning, counteracting AI-synthesized fake images and texts, debugging ML from unified data-model perspectives, and ‘green’ AdvML towards environmental sustainability. Second, we will organize a new section, AI Trust in Industry, by inviting industry experts to introduce the practical trend of AdvML, technological innovations, products, and societal impacts (e.g., AI’s responsibility). Third, we will host a Show-and-Tell Demos in the poster session to allow demonstrations of innovations done by research and engineering groups in the industry, academia, and government entities.

In many real applications, however, models rest on algorithmic components that implement discrete decisions, or rely on discrete intermediate representations and structures. These discrete steps are intrinsically non-differentiable and accordingly break the flow of gradients. To use gradient-based approaches to learn the parameters of such models requires turning these non-differentiable components differentiable. This can be done with careful considerations, notably, using smoothing or relaxations to propose differentiable proxies for these components. With the advent of modular deep learning frameworks, these ideas have become more popular than ever in many fields of machine learning, generating in a short time-span a multitude of \"differentiable everything\", impacting topics as varied as rendering, sorting and ranking, convex optimizers, shortest-paths, dynamic programming, physics simulations, NN architecture search, top-k, graph algorithms, weakly- and self-supervised learning, and many more.", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_11>>time": "Sat Jul 29 03:00 AM -- 11:00 AM (CST)", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_11>>location": " Meeting Room 314 None", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_11>>workshop": "PAC-Bayes Meets Interactive Learning", "ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Workshops>>2023 accepted workshops>>workshops>>workshops_11>>content": "Interactive learning encompasses online learning, continual learning, active learning, bandits, reinforcement learning, and other settings where an algorithm must learn while interacting with a continual stream of data.

As a result, both probabilistic and deep interactive learning methods are growing in popularity. However, acquiring observations in an interactive fashion with the environment can be costly. There is therefore great interest in understanding when sample-efficient learning with probabilistic and deep interactive learning can be expected or guaranteed. Within statistical learning theory, PAC-Bayesian theory is designed for the analysis of probabilistic learning methods.

A closed-loop sequential decision-making domain offers unique challenges when learning from humans -– (1) the data distribution may be influenced by the choices of the algorithm itself, and thus interactive ML algorithms need to adaptively learn from human feedback, (2) the nature of the environment itself changes rapidly, (3) humans may express their intent in various forms of feedback amenable to naturalistic real-world settings, going beyond tagged rewards or demonstrations.

Such applications have played an important role in the past, but lately we do not see much work on duality principles, especially in deep learning. For example, Lagrange duality can be useful for model explanation because it allows us to measure sensitivity of certain perturbations, but this is not yet fully exploited.

Expert models only describe idealized versions of the world which may hinder their deployment for important tasks such as accurate forecasting or parameter inference. This workshop focuses on the combination of two modelling paradigms: scientific and ML modelling. Sometimes called hybrid learning or grey-box modelling, this combination should 1) unlock new applications for expert models, and 2) leverage the data compressed within scientific models to improve the quality of modern ML models. In this spirit, the workshop focuses on the symbiosis between these two complementary modelling approaches; it aims to be a “rendezvous” between the involved communities, spanning sub-fields of science, engineering and health, and encompassing ML, to allow them to present their respective problems and solutions and foster new collaborations.

These lawsuits will lead to policies and legal rulings that define our ability, as ML researchers and practitioners, to acquire training data, and our responsibilities towards data owners and curators.
