Is the paper well organized and clearly written? Does it do a good job at explaining the novelty and the results? Does the paper include enough information needed to support the claims it makes? There is an overlap here with soundness: Sometimes soundness cannot be decided if the claims in the paper are not well supported, sometimes it can still be decided (e.g. by the reviewer doing additional work; we do not expect though reviewers doing this work). In cases like this, note on the previous item that soundness cannot be decided for reasons explained under this heading. For experimental papers, it is a presentation issue if the paper did not include enough details to reproduce the experimental results with a reasonable effort. A superbly written experimental paper explains: (1) why were the experimental conditions selected the way they were selected; (2) the subsequent choices of what to measure and what to plot (including perhaps what is not shown); (3) how the results obtained substantiate the claims made. The paper should follow standard, best practices (e.g., includes error bars, better yet, uses box plots or something similar unless you suspect near Gaussian variables, etc.)\n\nICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Papers>>Author Instructions>>Submissions>>instructions>>instructions_1>>Submitted papers are composed of a main body, which can be up to eight pages long, followed by unlimited pages for references and an appendix, all in a single file.

For details concerning the format of the papers, please see the LaTeX style files, an example paper, and the Call For Papers. There is no support for any software other than LaTeX. All submissions must be via OpenReview, anonymized, and must closely follow the formatting guidelines in the templates; otherwise, they will automatically be rejected. In particular, any submission whose main body goes over the 8 page limit will be automatically rejected. (For the final version, an extra page will be allowed.

We welcome submissions around training and inference systems/algorithms for foundation models, focusing on scaling-up or on reducing compute, time, memory, bandwidth, and energy requirements. Notably, we encourage submissions concerning the entire spectrum of foundation models: from BERT-sized Transformers, to large models with 100B+ parameters.
