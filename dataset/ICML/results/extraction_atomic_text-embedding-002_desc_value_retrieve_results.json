At the end of the first review round, if there is a broad agreement on a clear outcome, the AE may recommend accept or reject decision. If not, the submission will be invited for a revision followed by a second round of review.\n\nRebuttals: Before the discussion phase starts between reviewers and decisions are made, authors will have a few days to read the reviews and submit an optional short rebuttal. The sole purpose of the rebuttal is to clarify misunderstandings and factual errors through pointers to specific text in the submitted paper. As an example, a reviewer may have overlooked a part of the discussion in the paper and state that the paper fails to compare with a certain method; an example rebuttal will be of the form \"see Section 2.4, paragraph 3\". If no factual errors exist in the reviews, a rebuttal is not needed.\n\nRevisions: Some papers will be invited to submit a revised version of their paper. Authors will have one month to implement the revision items. The revision process is intended to be a constructive partnership between reviewers and authors. To this end, reviewers will be instructed to request revisions only in constructive scenarios with specific requests. In turn, authors bear the responsibility of attempting to meet those requests within the stated time frame, or of withdrawing the paper from submission. Common revision requests can include ''justify a crucial assumption'', ''present a real(istic) scenario where the defined problem occurs'', ''clean up notation'', ''tighten presentation'', ''compare against some relevant previous system'', ''show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or from a real system''. Revisions will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original. For all tracks, one extra content page is allowed after the first review to accommodate the requested revision items and a cover page to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revision items. Authors are encouraged to highlight parts of their revised manuscripts that are edited in a different color to ease their identification by the reviewers.": 0.19169121980667114}, "What is included in the virtual pass for the ICML2023 conference?": {"SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Conference Format>>To have the best experience for all the attendees and facilitate the active discussions and collaborations between presenters and attendees, the 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference and all co-located events (such as Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demos, Competitions, etc.) will be in-person. Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:\n\nThere will be NO live streaming or remote participation. The event will be geared towards 100% in-person attendance at the conference venue.\nEach paper should have at least one author registered for in-person attendance and presentation. At least one author must register for the conference before the camera ready submission deadline, otherwise, the paper will not appear in the proceedings. Please include your CMT paper ID, assigned during the review process, when you register for the conference.\nIf a paper cannot have an in-person presenter, the authors need to provide a valid justification, e.g., travel restrictions from their government or visa application not granted for even one author etc.\nFor a paper that cannot have an in-person presenter (due to a valid justification), the authors are expected to communicate with the respective chairs to submit a pre-recorded video or make alternative presentation arrangements.\nWe plan to record some in-person plenary sessions (e.g., Keynote and Award talks) and make them available at a future date AFTER the conference as part of the ACM digital library.\nWe plan to collect pre-recorded videos for the
