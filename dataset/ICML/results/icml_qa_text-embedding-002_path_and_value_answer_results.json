If your poster is for a workshop, check with your workshop organizer for details. Usually, posters for a workshop are put up on the day of the workshop. You will need to be logged onto the conference website in order to see the Paper browser and note the location and time of your poster on your paper's virtual page. If you wish, ICML2023 also provides a beta-testing poster printing service which allows you to upload a poster PDF or Adobe Illustrator image to be printed and available for pickup onsite at the convention center."}, {"query": "What is the review process for the ICML2023 conference?", "output": "The ICML2023 conference is following a single-phase reviewing process. First, all papers are allocated to three or more reviewers. After these reviewers submit their assessments, the feedback is shared with the authors. The authors are then invited to participate in a rebuttal process where they can provide feedback to the reviewers. This feedback is used during a reviewer discussion and in the final decision-making process. Reviewers carefully read and assess papers, they then provide critical feedback to authors, and appraise the papers' strengths. Meta-reviewers work with reviewers to reach a decision through discussion and deliberation and compile meta-reviews to highlight the most salient points. Senior Meta-Reviewers coordinate and calibrate the Meta-Reviewer recommendations and become involved in the peer review and decision process in more challenging and unusual situations. The final decision made in this process is final."}, {"query": "What is the policy on dual submission for ICML2023?", "output": "The dual submission policy for ICML2023 states that it is not appropriate to submit papers that are substantially similar or identical in content to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or are under review at other peer-reviewed conferences or journals while also under consideration for ICML. This is considered a violation of their dual submission policy and may lead to the paper being rejected.\n\nHowever, submissions are allowed for papers presented or to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings (like ICML or NeurIPS workshops) or with only abstracts limited to at most 4 pages published. Papers that have previously been made available as a technical report or preprint can also be submitted, though it's suggested that authors do not cite the report to preserve anonymity."}, {"query": "What are some measures taken by the ICML conference to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion?", "output": "The ICML conference takes several steps to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. They work with grassroots organizations like Women in Machine Learning, Black in AI, Queer in AI, LatinX in AI, and Indigenous in AI to increase participation of underrepresented groups at the conference. They also organize affinity events in collaboration with these groups, including workshops, mentoring sessions, and socials. They strive to make the conference itself more inclusive by promoting gender-inclusive measures, supporting childcare, nursing mothers, and attendees with disabilities. They are also considering options with the venue and caterers to ensure that everyone can have a positive, equitable experience while attending the conference. Persons with concerns related to inclusion can contact the Diversity and Inclusion co-chairs or the Conference HR Liaison."}, {"query": "What are the ethics guidelines Authors need to follow while submitting their work to ICML?", "output": "Authors submitting their work to ICML need to confirm that their submissions agree with the ICML code of conduct. They must follow standard ethical guidelines which strictly forbid plagiarism in any form and the unethical use of privileged information. Authors are not allowed to include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) like ChatGPT unless it is presented as part of the paper's experimental analysis. Authors are also expected to follow the NeurIPS Ethics Guidelines. All papers are expected to be evaluated based on their contents, including soundness, originality, significance, relevance to ICML, and quality of writing/presentation. In addition, authors should ensure that their papers promote best practices for responsible machine learning research, including reproducibility, ethics, transparency, and impact on society. Any violations of these ethics guidelines will be investigated and may lead to sanctions."}, {"query": "What is the submission format for ICML 2023 workshops?", "output": "The submission format for ICML 2023 workshops should clearly specify the following: \n\n1. Similar past and current events at ICML and NeurIPS in the last 1-2 years, even if not organized by the present workshop organizers. New workshops are welcome to build on prior workshops if a good case is made; completely original workshops are also welcome. \n2. A brief description of the topics to be covered, and an explanation as to why the workshop will appeal to ICML audiences.\n\nIn addition, to facilitate the participation of people unable to travel, workshop contents should be available online. Workshop organizers are asked to manage the virtual elements (e.g., hosting and recording presentations and papers, streaming, and virtual poster sessions). The ICML organizers will assist with central support as needed."}, {"query": "What is the process of reviewing for ICML2023 conference?", "output": "For ICML 2023, a single-phase reviewing process is adopted. In the first phase, all papers are assigned to three or more reviewers. Once all reviews are received, they are shared with the authors, who are then given an opportunity to provide feedback to the reviewers through a rebuttal process. This feedback is used in a reviewer discussion and then in the final decision-making process. As specified by the organization, reviewers carefully read and evaluate papers, present feedback to the authors, and assess the strengths of the papers. The meta-reviewers work with reviewers to reach a decision through discussion, and provide meta-reviews to authors highlighting the most important points. Senior meta-reviewers coordinate and calibrate the meta-reviewer recommendations, and assist with the peer review and decision process in more challenging situations. All decisions made are final."}, {"query": "What are the instructions for submitting supplementary material for ICML2023?", "output": "ICML2023 supports submission of two types of supplementary material -- supplementary manuscripts and code/data. If there is an anonymous reference in the paper, authors should upload the referenced papers so the reviewers can verify the results in the referred paper. The supplementary material must be anonymized. The supplementary code can be submitted as either a zip file or a pdf. Data submissions from anonymous repositories are also welcome, given the authors have the right to do so. Supplementary material will not be published or archived and there are no format restrictions. Therefore, if authors want to refer to it in the final version of their paper, they are responsible for its archival and access. It is up to the reviewers to decide if they wish to consult this additional material, hence any material critical for the evaluation of the paper should be included in the main paper."}, {"query": "What review aspects should be considered when reviewing papers submitted to ICML 2023?", "output": "The review aspects that should be considered when reviewing papers submitted to ICML 2023 include the soundness, originality, significance, relevance to ICML, and quality of writing/presentation of the paper's content. The paper should be based on original research and must contain novel results of significant interest to the machine learning community, whether theoretical or empirical. The degree of objective establishment of the results, their potential for scientific and technological impact, and the reproducibility of results should be taken into account. Factors like the easy availability of code should also be considered when applicable. Furthermore, the review should demonstrate an understanding of the paper, provide opinions about its relevancy, soundness, novelty, completeness, and present any ways the paper can be improved. Reviewers need to ensure they work collaboratively towards publishing papers that readers will find useful, interesting, and easy to read."}, {"query": "How is the double-blind reviewing policy implemented for ICML2023?", "output": "The double-blind reviewing policy for ICML2023 is implemented as follows:\n\n1. All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy. This includes not citing previous works of the authors or sharing links in a way that could reveal any author‚Äôs identity or institution.\n\n2. Authors are allowed to post versions of their work on preprint servers such as arXiv and to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted to ICML during the review period, but the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version if it has been posted online.\n\n3. ICML discourages advertising the preprint on social media or in the press while the work is under submission to ICML. And under no circumstance should the work be explicitly identified as ICML submission at any time during the review period, starting from the time the paper is submitted to the time the acceptance or rejection decisions are communicated."}, {"query": "What expectations are there from presenters of a tutorial at ICML 2023?", "output": "Presenters of a tutorial at ICML 2023 are expected to give a tutorial that is of interest to part of the ICML audience and serve some clear objectives. Their proposal should detail what the tutorial will be about, providing an outline of what they plan to cover, including references and how much time they will spend on each topic. The tutorial should cover a core machine learning topic or an emerging topic of importance for machine learning broadly, and it should demonstrate coverage and representativeness of the chosen area of research, rather than focusing solely on the presenter's own results or tools. The tutorial should answer why it is important to include it as a part of ICML 2023. Presenters also need to commit to presenting their tutorial in person. If they can't afford to attend the conference, ICML may partially reimburse their travel, lodging, and conference costs. Lastly, the presenters must confirm that their tutorial accords with the ICML code of conduct."}, {"query": "What are the guidelines for submitting a tutorial proposal for ICML 2023?", "output": "The guidelines for submitting a tutorial proposal for ICML 2023 are as follows: \n\n1.
