To encourage workshop variety, all workshops will be one-day workshops.The workshops can be on any subject relevant to a significant fraction of the ICML community. Schedules may encourage lively debates, and topics should lean more towards exploring new ideas, open problems, and interdisciplinary areas compared to the main conference. Workshops should encourage contributed content and reserve a significant portion of time for open/panel discussions and posters. A diverse group of speakers is more likely to bring diverse and surprising viewpoints on a topic.

For this year, we seek this information to assess consistency of self-perception with respect to review outcomes. We will not share rankings with co-authors, reviewers, ACs, or SACs.

The questions are mostly framed in terms of transparency: \"Did you include [information]?\" While \"yes\" is generally preferable to \"no\", it is perfectly acceptable to answer \"no\" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., \"error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive\" or \"we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used\"). In general, answering \"no\" or \"n/a\" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgement and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material.\n\nQuestion:Is the number of reviewers for every article fixed?\nAnswer:", "gt": "No", "response": "No, the number of reviewers for every article is not fixed."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "Are accepted papers at the conference contributed by the sponsor?", "retrieve_results": {"ICML2023>>Journal to Conference Track>>Request to present>>FAQ>>FAQ_5>>Q>>Will the paper be included in the chosen conference’s proceedings?": 0.009639382362365723, "ICML2023>>Journal to Conference Track>>Request to present>>FAQ>>FAQ_7>>Q>>The journal has confirmed my paper is accepted by email, however the paper doesn't yet appear in the proceedings.
