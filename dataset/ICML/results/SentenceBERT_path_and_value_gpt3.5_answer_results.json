Is the paper appropriately placed into contemporary literature? If not, be specific about what is missing. Note that oftentimes it is a question of judgement of whether a result should be mentioned as papers are subject to page limits. The must-mention results are directly relevant to the topic of the paper. If you ask authors to include other papers, you will need to declare (privately, see below) whether you are an author of any of the recommended papers. It is OK to recommend relevant papers authored by yourself, however, it is not OK to recommend papers that are not relevant to be included. When in doubt, it is better to err on the side of not recommending your own papers (or ask the MR). It is not reasonable to expect a paper to refer to unpublished works that appeared within one month before the submission deadline. Concurrent works should be referred to, but cannot be held against the paper in terms of novelty. Often, these are delicate decisions and reviewers should consult their MR for guidance. \n\nICML2023>>Journal to Conference Track>>Request to present>>FAQ>>FAQ_7>>Q>>The journal has confirmed my paper is accepted by email, however the paper doesn't yet appear in the proceedings.
