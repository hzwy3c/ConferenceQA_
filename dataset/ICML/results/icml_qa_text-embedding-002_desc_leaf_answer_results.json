They should ensure that virtual speakers are committed to engaging with other participants throughout the day of the workshop and should provide a means for interaction between the physical and virtual components of the workshop. They are also evaluated on the degree to which they provide means to engage in the workshop for those who are unable to attend in person. The organizers are provided with a Zoom license by ICML to facilitate this.

The supplementary code can be submitted as either a zip file or a pdf. Authors are encouraged to foster reproducibility by submitting the code, but should avoid submitting links to non-anonymized repositories and instead opt to submit the code base itself or anonymized repositories.\n\nIt's important to note that supplementary material will not be published or archived.
