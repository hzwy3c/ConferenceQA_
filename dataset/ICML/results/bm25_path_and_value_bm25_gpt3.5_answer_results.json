The must-mention results are directly relevant to the topic of the paper. If you ask authors to include other papers, you will need to declare (privately, see below) whether you are an author of any of the recommended papers. It is OK to recommend relevant papers authored by yourself, however, it is not OK to recommend papers that are not relevant to be included.

Is the paper appropriately placed into contemporary literature? If not, be specific about what is missing. Note that oftentimes it is a question of judgement of whether a result should be mentioned as papers are subject to page limits. The must-mention results are directly relevant to the topic of the paper. If you ask authors to include other papers, you will need to declare (privately, see below) whether you are an author of any of the recommended papers. It is OK to recommend relevant papers authored by yourself, however, it is not OK to recommend papers that are not relevant to be included. When in doubt, it is better to err on the side of not recommending your own papers (or ask the MR). It is not reasonable to expect a paper to refer to unpublished works that appeared within one month before the submission deadline. Concurrent works should be referred to, but cannot be held against the paper in terms of novelty. Often, these are delicate decisions and reviewers should consult their MR for guidance. \n\nICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Papers>>Author Instructions>>Videos>>Each paper will be given the opportunity to record a 5 min video.

Workshops will last for one day, with morning and afternoon sessions and free time between the sessions for individual exchange. To encourage workshop variety, all workshops will be one-day workshops.The workshops can be on any subject relevant to a significant fraction of the ICML community. Schedules may encourage lively debates, and topics should lean more towards exploring new ideas, open problems, and interdisciplinary areas compared to the main conference. Workshops should encourage contributed content and reserve a significant portion of time for open/panel discussions and posters. A diverse group of speakers is more likely to bring diverse and surprising viewpoints on a topic. As a result, we encourage workshop organizers to be cognizant of designing panels and speaker lists that are inclusive.", "response": "The goal of the workshop in ICML2023 is to predict and analyze the dynamics of learning algorithms when the number of samples and parameters are large."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "Who are the program chairs?", "retrieve_results": {"ICML2023>>Calls>>Call For Papers>>Publication Ethics>>Program committee and reviewers>>Conflicts>>PC members/reviewers must disclose any conflicts of interest to the program chairs.
