All topics relevant to the conference will be considered, but preference will be given to proposals that address an emerging research area and emphasize open research questions. Proposals must provide an in-depth and contemporary survey of the chosen area, covering a broad corpus of the related literature – in particular, while presenters have the option of describing exemplar pieces of work in detail, they should not focus exclusively on their own contributions. Proposals should indicate the tutorial length – 1.5 or 3 hours; if the tutorial can be of either length, the material included for each case should be clearly identified. Further, the proposal should identify any prior venues in which all or part of the tutorial has been presented, and explain how the current proposal differs from these previous editions. Finally, tutorial proposals must clearly identify the intended audience, prerequisite knowledge expected from the attendees, and the expected benefits to the participants.\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to_13>>ML functionality inside DBMS\n\nQuestion:Who are the tutorial chairs?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The tutorial chairs are Laure Berti-Equille, Wook-Shin Han and Xi He.", "response": "I don't know."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "Who are the workshop chairs?", "retrieve_results": {"ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to_13>>ML functionality inside DBMS": 0, "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to_6>>Data management during the lifecycle of ML models": 0, "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to_10>>Machine learning for query optimization": 0, "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to_4>>Model-aware data discovery, cleaning, and transformation": 0, "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to>>Topics of particular interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to_9>>Learned database design, configuration and tuning": 0}, "from": "ICED2023/General Info/Organizing Committee/Workshop Chairs", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

Proposals must provide an in-depth and contemporary survey of the chosen area, covering a broad corpus of the related literature – in particular, while presenters have the option of describing exemplar pieces of work in detail, they should not focus exclusively on their own contributions. Proposals should indicate the tutorial length – 1.5 or 3 hours; if the tutorial can be of either length, the material included for each case should be clearly identified. Further, the proposal should identify any prior venues in which all or part of the tutorial has been presented, and explain how the current proposal differs from these previous editions.
