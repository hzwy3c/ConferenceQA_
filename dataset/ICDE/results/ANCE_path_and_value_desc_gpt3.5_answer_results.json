The award should be used to pay costs related to attending the conference.\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Participate>>Student Travel Award>>Service Requirement>>Awardees are expected to volunteer at the conference activities (e.g., registration desk, session assistance, AV tables, workshops, etc) for a number of hours during the conference week. You get to pick your time slots upon availability. So, we will collaborate to enable everyone not to miss anything they want to attend.\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Participate>>Student Travel Award>>Eligibility>>The applicant must be a full-time student (undergraduate or graduate) in a US-based institution. Applicants do not need to have an accepted paper to be eligible. However, students who are primary authors of an accepted paper in the main conference or the workshops are especially encouraged to apply.\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Participate>>Student Travel Award>>Questions>>You may send your questions regarding the travel award application process to Amr Magdy (amr@cs.ucr.edu).\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Participate>>Student Travel Award>>Travel Award Selection Committee>>Travel Award Selection Committee_4>>Faisal Nawab, University of California, Irvine\n\nQuestion:What is the amount of the student travel award?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The award value is 450 USD as a financial stipend to partially cover the expense of attending the conference in person.
