One system being faster than another for one particular workload can have a multitude of reasons, which makes absolute performance numbers hard to interpret. In this talk we therefore study the affect of implementation techniques while staying within one execution engine, our research system Umbra. We discuss a number of techniques we have used to speed up query processing, and try to quantify their impact by explicitly disabling them. Which gives an overview over how impactful individual techniques are and what has to be implemented to get a fast database system.\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>DBML 2023>>Keynotes>>Keynotes_1>>speaker>>affiliation>>Gray System Lab, Microsoft\n\nICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>HardBD&Active 2023>>Keynote Talks>>Keynote Talks_3>>title>>The Data Systems Grammar\n\nQuestion:Are there any keynotes talks related to database systems?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes, the keynote talk 'What Makes Database Systems Fast?
