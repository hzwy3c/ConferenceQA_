Another example is the use of oppressive terminology, such as using the term \"Master-Slave\" to describe a distributed data system architecture. Finally, writing should always consider accessibility, for example, not using color alone to convey information in a plot, as it can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Instead, patterns, symbols, textures, or a color-blind friendly palette should be used to emphasize and contrast visual elements."}, {"query": "What are the details of the conference hotel and any special offers provided?", "output": "The conference hotel for ICDE2023 is the Anaheim Marriott, located at 700 W Convention Way, Anaheim, CA 92802.
