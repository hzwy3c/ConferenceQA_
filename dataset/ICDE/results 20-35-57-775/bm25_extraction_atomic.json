[{"question": "What is the purpose of the ICED2023 conference?", "answer": "1. ICDE2023: Menu: Call for Contributions: Workshops Track: TKDE Poster Session Track: Registration policy: The extended abstract will appear in the ICDE 2023 proceedings under a special track for TKDE papers, and the authors must present the work at the ICDE poster session. Regarding the policy of ICDE registrations, the authors of an extended abstract (TKDE posters) will be treated in the same way as the authors of an ICDE paper. At least one of the authors must register for the conference before the camera-ready deadline, and this registration can be cancelled only after registration of another author. The registration is based on attendance; that is, if an author is going to ICDE 2023 to present multiple posters or papers accepted for ICDE, we only charge the author once for ICDE registration.\n\n2. ICDE2023: Menu: Call for Contributions: Workshops Track: Demonstration Track: Video Submission: We encourage the submission of a demonstration video (of up to 5 minutes, 50MB max. file size) together with your demonstration proposal. The purpose of the video is to convey an impression of what will be demonstrated and need not show the final version. Both the demonstration proposal and the video will then be accessible by the reviewers. Your video could summarize your demonstration and also audio-visually highlight its most important aspects, such as the user interface, options for user interactions, the system setup, etc. The video should be submitted in MPEG/AVI/MP4 format and be playable by the common media players. Please note that you will need to first finish your demo proposal submission and then edit it to add the video as a supplementary file.\n\nBased on these references, the purpose of the ICDE2023 conference is to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss their work in the field of data engineering. The conference includes workshops, keynote talks, and poster sessions where researchers can showcase their extended abstracts and demonstrations. Presenting at the conference requires registration, and authors are encouraged to submit video demonstrations to enhance their proposals. The conference aims to advance the field of data engineering and facilitate exchange and collaboration among researchers and practitioners."}, {"question": "What is the date of the ICED2023 conference?", "answer": "1.
