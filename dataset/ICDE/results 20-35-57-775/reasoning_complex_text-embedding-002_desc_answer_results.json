For the Undergrad/K-12 Research Competition, submissions should be original work, written in English with a maximum length of four printed pages in IEEE format without references. Templates are available at the ICDE 2023 submission guidelines page. Submissions are to be made to https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ASTRIDE2023. Video submissions along with the paper are encouraged but not compulsory. Accepted submissions will be included in the open proceedings of the workshop."}]
