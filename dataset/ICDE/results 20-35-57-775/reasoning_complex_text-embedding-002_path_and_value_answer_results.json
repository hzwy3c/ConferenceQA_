All work must be original and not be under consideration for publication in any other forum. The manuscript should contain the research problem, proposed methodology, the contributions made so far, and future work. Papers should be prepared in IEEE format and submitted as a single PDF file. The submissions are to be made to the provided submission sites such as: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/HardBDActive2023 for the HardBD&Active 2023 workshop and https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ASTRIDE2023 for the Undergrad/K-12 Research Competition. After submission, the papers will undergo a reviewing process where each paper will receive at least three reviews. Papers might be invited for revision if deemed necessary by the panel of reviewers, with authors given a month to prepare their revisions. Lastly, accepted papers will be included in the open proceedings of the workshop."}]
