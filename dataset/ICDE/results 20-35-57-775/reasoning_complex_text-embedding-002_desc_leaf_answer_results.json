Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered. Papers that do not follow the guidelines or are not within the scope of topics relevant to ICDE will be desk rejected. Papers cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the time it is considered for ICDE 2023, and should be substantially different from any previously published work. Each submission must include all author names and affiliations. Changes to the author list after paper acceptance are not permitted unless explained via email to the industrial track chairs. All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings. Any paper from which none of the authors attend to present will be subject to removal from IEEE Xplore."}]
