Such interconnections rely on a vast network of multiple actors whose trustworthiness is not always guaranteed. Over the past three decades, rapid advances in computing and communication technologies have enabled billions of users with access to information and connectivity at their fingertips. Unfortunately, this rapid digitization of our personal lives is also now vulnerable to invasion of privacy. In particular, now we have to worry about the malicious intent of individual actors in the network as well as large and powerful organizations such as service providers and nation states. In the backdrop of this reality of the untrusted world, we raise the following research questions: (i) Can we design a scalable infrastructure for voice communication that will hide the knowledge of who is communicating with whom? (ii) Can we design a scalable system for oblivious search for documents from public repositories? (iii) Can we develop scalable solutions for private query processings over public databases? These are some of the iconic problems that must be solved before we can embark on building trusted platforms and services over untrusted infrastructures. In this talk, we present a detailed overview of a system for voice communication that hides communication metadata over fully untrusted infrastructures and scales to tens of thousands of users. We also note that solutions to the above problems rely on an intermediary service provider. We conclude this talk with an open question on the efficacy of a decentralized paradigm for cryptocurrency in the broader context of our digital lives that can potentially eliminate the need for an intermediary in provisioning trusted services and platforms.": 0.1804560422897339, "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Program>>Detailed Program>>In-person Program>>In-person Program_4>>schedule>>schedule_2>>events>>events_1>>event>>keynote>>title>>What makes database systems fast?
