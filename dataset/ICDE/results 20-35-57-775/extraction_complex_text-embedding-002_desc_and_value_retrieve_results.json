Steps involved in an ML pipeline, such as data preparation and cleaning, feature engineering and management of the ML lifecycle, can benefit from research conducted by the data management community. For example, the management of the ML lifecycle requires mechanisms for modeling, storing and querying ML artifacts. Moreover, in many use cases pipelines require a mixture of relational and linear algebra operators raising the question of whether a seamless integration between the two algebras is possible.\nIn the opposite direction, ML techniques are explored in core components of database systems, e.g., query optimization, indexing and monitoring. Traditionally hard problems in databases, such as cardinality estimation, or problems with high human supervision like DB administration, might benefit more from learning algorithms than from rule-based or cost-based approaches.\nThe workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners in the intersection of DB and ML research, providing a forum for DB-inspired or ML-inspired approaches addressing challenges encountered in each of the two areas.
