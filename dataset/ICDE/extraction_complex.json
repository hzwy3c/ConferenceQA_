        "question": "How do I register for the ICDE2023 conference?",
        "answer": " The event requires each paper (including the conference and workshops) to pay an author fee for the work to be published and presented at the event.  Separately, attendees including the presenting authors need to pay a registration fee. The registration website will require each paper to pay both an author fee and a registration fee (either student or non-student). A main reason to use this fee structure, which is adopted by many other events, is to deal with the uncertainty and risk of the conference budget caused by the economic environment and global pandemic.",
