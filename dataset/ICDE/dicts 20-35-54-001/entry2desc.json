The mix of algorithms, technologies, fintech analytics, and visualization allows companies to keep an eye on trends and quickly react to changes. The 1st International Workshop on Big Data Analytics in Finance and Commerce (BDAFC 2023) aims to provide a forum for researchers from academia and industry to exchange ideas, techniques, and application scenarios in financial data analytics, as well as discuss open challenges and identify new research directions in the area. The workshop will interest researchers in developing financial and commercial data analytics techniques in various application domains. The intended audiences include researchers from academia and industry interested in exploiting the value of data science and data-driven technologies in finance.": "The path leads to the information about the \"1st International Workshop on Big Data Analytics in Finance and Commerce (BDAFC 2023)\" which will take place during the ICDE2023 conference. This workshop targets the challenges faced in efficiently indexing, retrieving, and managing the wide range of business and financial data on the internet caused by the explosive growth of e-business. It emphasizes the importance of developing new analytical techniques for easy application to big data in finance and commerce. \n\nIt has been noted how fintech has enhanced customer experience over the past years by understanding client behaviors and expectations. The use of data-driven technologies has aided financial organizations in solving daily issues. A combination of algorithms, technologies, fintech analytics, and visualization has enabled companies to keep track of trends and respond to changes promptly.\n\nThe BDAFC 2023 aims to provide a platform for academics and industry researchers to exchange ideas, techniques, and application scenarios in financial data analytics. It is also meant to inspire a discussion on open challenges and identification of new research directions in the field.

The ability to collect, store, process, and evaluate cooking recipes has advanced immeasurably, and data science-driven methods have had unprecedented impact on food experience sharing and recommendations at large, mainly because of their success in analys-ing and predicting human cooking expectation, flavour, and taste preferences. Data Engineering stands to benefit from the food computing and recipe cooking revolution in similar ways, but realizing this vision requires thoughtful and concerted effort. The 6th International Workshop on Data Engineering meets Intelligent Food and COoking Recipes (DECOR@ICDE2023) aims to accelerate research in data science by providing a forum for the latest innovations in the intersection of Data Engineering and Intelligent Food and Cooking Recipes. The workshop is specifically focusing on data science innovations that accelerate the organization, integra-tion, access, and sharing of digital objects in support of the Intelligent Food and Cooking Reci-pes domain. This domain comprises not only the process of cooking, but also includes intelli-gent methods for enhancing human-food interactions, ranging from devising technology, playful interactions, multisensory experience design, understanding cross-cultural food eating habits and perception, as well as food choices and their health connections.

A data system is a collection of data structures and algorithms working together to achieve complex data processing tasks. For example, with data systems that utilize the correct data structure design for the problem at hand, we can reduce the monthly bill of large-scale data applications on the cloud by hundreds of thousands of dollars. We can accelerate data science tasks by dramatically speeding up the computation of statistics over large amounts of data. We can train drastically more neural networks within a given time budget, improving accuracy. However, knowing the right data system design for any given scenario is a notoriously hard problem; there is a massive space of possible designs, while no single design is perfect across all data, queries, and hardware contexts. In addition, building a new system may take several years for any given (fixed) design.\nWe will discuss our quest for the first principles of data system design. We will show that it is possible to reason about this massive design space. This allows us to create a self-designing data system that can take drastically different shapes to optimize for the workload, hardware, and available cloud budget using a grammar for data systems.

A data system is a collection of data structures and algorithms working together to achieve complex data processing tasks. Utilizing the right data structure design, we can significantly reduce the costs of large-scale data applications, accelerate data science tasks, and train more neural networks within a time budget. However, the right design for any given scenario is a challenging problem due to the massive potential design space. Building a new system may also take several years. In this talk, we discuss our search for the first principles of data system design, arguing that it's possible to reason about and navigate this vast design space. This reasoning allows us to create a self-designing data system that adapts its structure, algorithms, and overall design to optimize the workload, hardware, and budget limitations by using a grammar for data systems. This self-designing system can discover and create efficient designs that may not exist yet in the current literature or industry, achieving speeds over 10 times faster.\"", "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>HardBD&Active 2023>>PC Members>>PC Members_3>>affiliation>>Univerisity of Science and Technology of China": "The text of the path for easy retrieval is: \n\nICDE2023, Menu, Workshops, HardBD&Active 2023, PC Members, PC Members_3, affiliation, University of Science and Technology of China.", "ICDE2023>>Menu>>Workshops>>HardBD&Active 2023>>Keynote Talks>>Keynote Talks_3>>Bio>>Stratos Idreos is an associate professor of Computer Science at Harvard University, where he leads the Data Systems Laboratory.
