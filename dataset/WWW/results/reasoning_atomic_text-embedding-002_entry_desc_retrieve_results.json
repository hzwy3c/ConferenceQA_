In the multi-task setting where each agent is asked multiple questions, a sequence of mechanisms have been proposed which are truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be an equilibrium, or even better, informed truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be one of the best-paid equilibria.

This method can achieve either (1), (3) and (4), or (2), (3) and (4) in the binary effort setting. In this paper, we suggest using a rank-order payment function (tournament). Assuming Gaussian noise, we analytically optimize the rank-order payment function, and identify a sufficient statistic, sensitivity, which serves as a metric for optimizing the performance measurements. This helps us obtain (1), (2) and (3) simultaneously. Additionally, we show that adding noise to agents’ scores can preserve the truthfulness of the performance measurements under the non-linear tournament, which gives us all four objectives.": 0.1451910138130188}, "What is the main theme of the Web Sci2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_7>>Health and well-being online": 0.09569263458251953, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_1>>Social machines, crowd computing and collective intelligence": 0.09670132398605347, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Doing Web Science>>Doing Web Science_5>>Detecting, preventing and predicting anomalies in Web data (e.g., fake content, spam)": 0.09871101379394531, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_3>>Legal issues, including rights and accountability for AI actors": 0.10018110275268555, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_6>>Online education and remote learning": 0.10080462694168091, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>description>>Web-based technologies promise to lower the entry barrier for geographically-dispersed individuals to participate in everyday life.

A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding. The performance of these detection algorithms can be taken as a baseline for future research on detecting malicious bidding.": 0.12905728816986084}, "What are the significant updates for the 2023 ACM Web Conference?": {"WWW2023>>Attendees>>Virtual Participation Award>>The ACM SIGWEB Fair Access Virtual Participation Awards - Call for Applications>>Introduce>>Introduce_1>>The 2023 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with virtual components including live streaming of ceremonies and keynotes, access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees.": 0.09059345722198486, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>abstract>>This paper summarizes the content of the 28 tutorials that have been given at The Web Conference 2023.": 0.11757677793502808, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Introduce>>Introduce_1>>The 2023 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with virtual components including live streaming of ceremonies and keynotes, access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees.": 0.1199154257774353, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops_1>>abstract>>This paper introduces the 20 workshops that were organized at The Web Conference 2023.": 0.12110251188278198, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>sections>>sections_1>>content>>content_10>>5-6PM: ACM A.M.
