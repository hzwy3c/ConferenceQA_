For delivery systems, improving address resolution positively impacts multiple downstream systems such as geocoding, route planning and delivery time estimations, leading to an efficient and reliable delivery experience, both for customers as well as delivery agents. Our proposed approach jointly leverages address text, past delivery information and concepts from graph theory to retrieve informative and diverse record pairs to label. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach on manually curated dataset across addresses from India (IN) and United Arab Emirates (UAE). We achieved absolute improvement in recall on average across IN and UAE while preserving precision over the existing production system. We also introduce delivery point (DP) geocode learning for cold-start addresses as a downstream application of address resolution. In addition to offline evaluation, we also performed online A/B experiments which show that when the production model is augmented with active learnt record pairs, the delivery precision improved by and delivery defects reduced by on an average across shipments from IN and UAE.": 0.13115710020065308

Its deployment also needs to consider challenges in scalability and downstream integration in order to translate modeling advances into better search result relevance. In this paper we present HierCat, the query categorization system at Facebook Marketplace. HierCat addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-task pre-training of dual-encoder architectures with a hierarchical inference step to effectively learn from weakly supervised training data mined from searcher engagement. We show that HierCat not only outperforms popular methods in offline experiments, but also leads to 1.4% improvement in NDCG and 4.3% increase in searcher engagement at Facebook Marketplace Search in two weeks of online A/B testing.": 0.13801944255828857,

Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it. GPT is writing my lecture now.": 0.11753511428833008,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_22>>abstract>>Vector quantization techniques, such as Product Quantization (PQ), play a vital role in approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNs) and maximum inner product search (MIPS) owing to their remarkable search and storage efficiency. However, the indexes in vector quantization cannot be trained together with the inference models since data indexing is not differentiable. To this end, differentiable vector quantization approaches, such as DiffPQ and DeepPQ, have been recently proposed, but existing methods have two drawbacks. First, they do not impose any constraints on codebooks, such that the resultant codebooks lack diversity, leading to limited retrieval performance. Second, since data indexing resorts to operator, differentiability is usually achieved by either relaxation or Straight-Through Estimation (STE), which leads to biased gradient and slow convergence. To address these problems, we propose a Differentiable Optimized Product Quantization method (DOPQ) and beyond in this paper. Particularly, each data is projected into multiple orthogonal spaces, to generate multiple views of data. Thus, each codebook is learned with one view of data, guaranteeing the diversity of codebooks. Moreover, instead of simple differentiable relaxation, DOPQ optimizes the loss based on direct loss minimization, significantly reducing the gradient bias problem. Finally, DOPQ is evaluated with seven datasets of both recommendation and image search tasks. Extensive experimental results show that DOPQ outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.": 0.11924189329147339,

Since QA systems are ascending the cycle of emerging technologies, there are potential research gaps that can be explored.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_5>>abstract>>In recent years, knowledge graph embeddings have achieved great success. Many methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks. However, most of the current methods present one or more of the following problems: (i) They only consider fact triplets, while ignoring the ontology information of knowledge graphs. (ii) The obtained embeddings do not contain much semantic information. Therefore, using these embeddings for semantic tasks is problematic. (iii) They do not enable large-scale training. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the ontology of knowledge graphs and partitions the knowledge graph based on classes to include more semantic information for parallel training of large-scale knowledge graph embeddings. Our preliminary results show that our algorithm performs well on several popular benchmarks.": 0.12183058261871338,

Following a short introduction motivating the reason why this issue has to be considered as pivotal both for the Web and for the society, the main problem raised by the research will be identified, namely, whether an action taken against a person, that in real-life would be a criminal conduct, is considerable as a crime in the Metaverse as well. A short assessment of the (very little so far) current state of the art, as well as the proposed approach and methodology will be then overviewed; finally, the contribution shows its current results, and concludes stating that countries are highly encouraged to shape respective criminal frameworks when applied to the Metaverse, and that the international community should consider the topic as a priority in its agenda.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_4>>abstract>>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) form the backbone of many knowledge dependent applications such as search engines and digital personal assistants. KGs are generally constructed either manually or automatically using a variety of extraction techniques applied over multiple data sources. Due to the diverse quality of these data sources, there are likely anomalies introduced into any KG. Hence, it is unrealistic to expect a perfect archive of knowledge. Given how large KGs can be, manual validation is impractical, necessitating an automated approach for anomaly detection in KGs. To improve KG quality, and to identify interesting and abnormal triples (edges) and entities (nodes) that are worth investigating, we introduce SEKA, a novel unsupervised approach to detect anomalous triples and entities in a KG using both the structural characteristics and the content of edges and nodes of the graph. While an anomaly can be an interesting or unusual discovery, such as a fraudulent transaction requiring human intervention, anomaly detection can also identify potential errors. We propose a novel approach named Corroborative Path Algorithm to generate a matrix of semantic features, which we then use to train a one-class Support Vector Machine to identify abnormal triples and entities with no dependency on external sources. We evaluate our approach on four real-world KGs demonstrating the ability of SEKA to detect anomalies, and to outperform comparative baselines.": 0.1322106122970581,

The current solutions upon Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) blindly smooth the representation of neiboring nodes, thus undermining the discriminative information of the anomalies. To alleviate the issue, recent studies identify and discard inter-class edges through estimating and comparing the node-level representation similarity. However, the representation of a single node can be misleading when the prediction error is high, thus hindering the performance of the edge indicator.": 0.16064465045928955

However, traditional ABR algorithms perform poorly on IPFS because the throughput cannot be estimated correctly. The main problem is that video segments can be retrieved from multiple sources, making it difficult to estimate the throughput. To overcome this issue, we have designed Telescope, an IPFS-aware ABR system. We conduct experiments on the IPFS network, where IPFS video providers are geographically distributed across the globe.

The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.": 0.14000999927520752

While current studies solely rely on graph-based fraud detection approaches, it is argued that they may not be well-suited for dealing with highly repetitive, skew-distributed and heterogeneous Ethereum transactions. To address these challenges, we propose BERT4ETH, a universal pre-trained Transformer encoder that serves as an account representation extractor for detecting various fraud behaviors on Ethereum. BERT4ETH features the superior modeling capability of Transformer to capture the dynamic sequential patterns inherent in Ethereum transactions, and addresses the challenges of pre-training a BERT model for Ethereum with three practical and effective strategies, namely repetitiveness reduction, skew alleviation and heterogeneity modeling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that BERT4ETH outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant enhancements in terms of the phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks.

However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations. We demonstrate our automated approach on several large ontologies from the oceanographic domain and show its agreement with a manual evaluation by domain experts and its superiority over the state-of-the-art.": 0.10283768177032471,

The Accord Project provides an open-source SLC framework containing three main modules: Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo. Currently, we need lawyers, programmers, and clients to work together with great effort to create a usable SLC using the Accord Project. This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project’s Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text. We also delve into some limitations and possible future research for the proposed pipeline. Finally, we describe a web interface enabling users to build SLCs.

To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations.

The smart city hub (SCHub) introduces a new concept that aims to homogenize data, service, human and material flows in cities. A proof of concept is based on non-typical data flows, like the ones that are collected by biotechnological activities, like Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally. Most of the diet related NCDs are related to the gut microbiome, the microbial community that resides in our gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance or loss of microbiome diversity is one of the main factors leading to NCDs by affecting various functions, including energy metabolism, intestinal permeability, and brain function. Gut dysbiosis is reflected in altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by the gut microbiota. A microcapsule system can play the role of a sensor that collects data from the local community and transmits it to the SCHub in order for the doctors to receive the appropriate patients information and define the appropriate treatment method; for the city to process anonymized information and measure community's health in diet terms. A prototype with a biosensor that correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacities is presented in this paper, together with the use-case scenario that engages the SCHub.": 0.14320683479309082,

It is important to make conscious decisions to keep harmony in sustainability. There are multiple frameworks to evaluate how sustainability is measured and to understand how sustainable a place is, be it a city or a region, and one such framework is the Circles of Sustainability. Though these frameworks offer good solutions, it is a challenge to collect relevant data to make the framework widely usable. This paper focuses on this specific issue by utilizing the methodology introduced in the framework and applying it practically to better understand how sustainable our cities and society are. We present a unique web-based application which utilizes publicly accessible data to compute sustainability scores and rank for every city and presents the results in an intelligent and easy to comprehend visual interface.

By simulating patients at a more fundamental level than conventional machine learning models, digital twins can provide unique insights by predicting each patient's outcome trajectory. This has numerous associated benefits, including patient-specific clinical decision-making support and the potential for large-scale virtual clinical trials. Historically, it has not been feasible to use digital twin technology to model cancer patients because of the large number of variables that impact each patient's outcome trajectory, including genotypic, phenotypic, social, and environmental factors. However, the path to digital twins in radiation oncology is becoming possible due to recent progress, such as multiscale modeling techniques that estimate patient-specific cellular, molecular, and histological distributions, and modern cryptographic techniques that enable secure and efficient centralization of patient data across multiple institutions. With these and other future scientific advances, digital twins for radiation oncology will likely become feasible.

Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of Hard Negative Sampling (HNS) have not been revealed yet. In this work, we fill the research gap by conducting thorough theoretical analyses on HNS. Firstly, we prove that employing HNS on the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) learner is equivalent to optimizing One-way Partial AUC (OPAUC). Concretely, the BPR equipped with Dynamic Negative Sampling (DNS) is an exact estimator, while with softmax-based sampling is a soft estimator. Secondly, we prove that OPAUC has a stronger connection with Top-K evaluation metrics than AUC and verify it with simulation experiments. These analyses establish the theoretical foundation of HNS in optimizing Top-K recommendation performance for the first time. On these bases, we offer two insightful guidelines for effective usage of HNS: 1) the sampling hardness should be controllable, e.g., via pre-defined hyper-parameters, to adapt to different Top-K metrics and datasets; 2) the smaller the K we emphasize in Top-K evaluation metrics, the harder the negative samples we should draw. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks verify the two guidelines.": 0.12924212217330933

In non-English speaking countries like India, Nepal and many others, the regional titles are transliterated from native language to English and are being searched in English. Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system. Typing errors make the problem even more challenging. Streaming services uses spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features to address this issue up to certain extent. Auto-suggest fails when user searches keywords not in scope of the auto-suggest.

This problem is aggravated when there is no behavioral data available for new content. Poor quality recommendation for these items lead to user dissatisfaction and short content shelf-life. In this paper we propose a solution MEMER (Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations), that utilises the multimodal semantic information of content and uses it to generate better quality embeddings for early-stage items. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by extending it to various explicit and implicit user actions. Using these learnt embeddings, we conduct offline and online experiments to verify its effectiveness. The predicted embeddings show significant gains in online early-stage experiments for both videos and images (videos:  44% relative gain in click through rate,  46% relative gain in explicit engagements,  9% relative gain in successful video play,  20% relative reduction in skips, images:  56% relative gain in explicit engagements). This also compares well against the performance of mature embeddings (83.3% RelaImpr (RI) [18] in Successful Video Play, 97.8% RelaImpr in Clicks).": 0.10525345802307129,

An entity can be a person, organization, work-of-art, etc., while an event, such as the Opioid epidemic, occurs at specific point(s) in time. ELTE first extracts key-phrases from episode title and description metadata. It then uses entity linking to canonicalize them against Wikipedia knowledge base (KB), ensuring that the topics exist in the real world. ELTE also models NIL-predictions for entity or event topics that are not in the KB, as well as topics that are not of entity or event type. To test the model, we construct a podcast topic database of 1166 episodes from various categories. Each episode comes with a Wiki-link annotated main topic or NIL-prediction. ELTE produces the best overall Exact Match EM score of .84, with by-far the best EM of .89 among the entity or event type episodes, as well as NIL-predictions for episodes without entity or event main topic (EM score of .86).": 0.056719839572906494,

Image selection significantly affects the user’s click-through rate (CTR). Most existing work considers the CTR as the target to find an appropriate image. However, these methods are challenging to deploy online efficiently. Also, the selected images may not relate to the item but are profitable to CTR, resulting in the undesirable phenomenon of enticing users to click on the item. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline method with content-based recall model and CTR-based ranking model. The first is realized as a joint method based on the title-image matching model and multi-modal knowledge graph embedding learning model. The second is a CTR-based visually aware scoring model, incorporating the entity textual information and entity images. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in offline evaluations. After a month of online A/B testing on a travel platform Fliggy, the relative improvement of our method is 5% with respect to seller selection on CTCVR in the searching scenario, and our method further improves pCTR from 3.48% of human pick to 3.53% in the recommendation scenario.": 0.16128861904144287,

The retriever aims to select a small set of relevant candidates from the entire items with high efficiency; while the ranker, usually more precise but time-consuming, is supposed to further refine the best items from the retrieved candidates. Traditionally, the two components are trained either independently or within a simple cascading pipeline, which is prone to poor collaboration effect.

Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos  accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios.": 0.10411620140075684,

To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_3>>abstract>>In conference peer review, reviewers are often asked to provide “bids” on each submitted paper that express their interest in reviewing that paper. A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>abstract>>Extensive literature argues that crowds possess essential collective intelligence benefits that allow superior decision-making by untrained individuals working in low-information environments. Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign. Our findings broaden the field of crowd-aware system design and inform discussions about the augmentation of traditional financing systems with tech innovations.": 0.131927490234375

In this paper, we propose a multi-step process to achieve the same. First, we explore the semantic sentence segmentation of SEBI case files via classification. We also propose a dataset of Indian legal adjudicating orders which contain tags from carefully crafted domain-specific sentence categories with the help of legal experts. We experiment with various machine learning and deep learning methods for this multi-class classification. Then, we examine the performance of numerous summarization methods on the segmented document to generate persona-specific summaries.

A general framework is to extract supporting evidence from the table and text and then perform numerical reasoning over extracted evidence for inferring the answer. However, existing models are vulnerable to missing supporting evidence, which limits their performance. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic-Oriented Hierarchical Graph (SoarGraph) that models the semantic relationships and dependencies among the different elements (e.g., question, table cells, text paragraphs, quantities, and dates) using hierarchical graphs to facilitate supporting evidence extraction and enhance numerical reasoning capability. We conduct our experiments on two popular benchmarks, FinQA and TAT-QA datasets, and the results show that our SoarGraph significantly outperforms all strong baselines, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness.": 0.10727947950363159,

We propose an anomaly detection approach based on network analysis to help AFC officers navigating through the high load of information that is typical of AFC data-driven scenarios. By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network metrics that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the metric-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system. This approach represents a preliminary step in the automation of AFC and AML processes, serving the purpose of facilitating the work of AFC officers by providing them with a top-down view of the picture emerging from financial data.": 0.12400174140930176

I look at three extraordinary examples of apps built for the Web, and analyze reasons their creators provided for doing so. In continuation, I look at the decline of interest in cross-platform app frameworks with the exception of Flutter, which leads me to the two research questions RQ1 \"Why do people not fully bet on PWA\" and RQ2 \"Why is Flutter so popular\". My hypothesis for why developers don’t more frequently set on the Web is that in many cases they (or their non-technical reporting lines) don’t realize how powerful it has become.

As personal computers grew in popularity, developers jumped at the opportunity to deploy cross-platform games with centralized management and a low barrier to entry. Simply going to the right address is now enough to start a game. From text-based to GPU-powered 3D games, browser gaming has evolved to become a strong alternative to traditional console and mobile-based gaming, targeting both casual and advanced gamers. Browser technology has also evolved to accommodate more demanding applications, sometimes even supplanting functions typically left to the operating system.

Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains. This will enable us to in the future explore what existing knowledge can be adapted or used to develop ontologies for circular value networks.": 0.1330062747001648,

However, most existing visualization recommendation systems focus on ranking all possible visualizations based on the attributes or encodings, which makes it difficult to find the most relevant insights. We therefore introduce a novel class of insight-based visualization recommendation systems that automatically rank and recommend groups of related insights as well as the most important insights within each group. Our approach combines results from different learning-based methods to discover insights automatically and generalizes to a variety of attribute types (e.g., categorical, numerical, and temporal), including non-trivial combinations of these attribute types. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we implemented a insight-centric visualization recommendation system, SpotLight, and conducted a user study with twelve participants, which showed that users are able to quickly find and understand relevant insights in unfamiliar data.": 0.12757039070129395,

In performing clustering, a similarity measure, which defines how similar a pair of data objects are, plays an important role. A similarity measure is employed by considering a target dataset’s characteristics. Current similarity measures (or distances) do not reflect the distribution of data objects in a dataset at all. From the clustering point of view, this fact may limit the clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose c-affinity, a new notion of a similarity measure that reflects the distribution of objects in the given dataset from a clustering point of view. We design c-affinity between any two objects to have a higher value as they are more likely to belong to the same cluster by learning the data distribution. We use random walk with restart (RWR) on the k-nearest neighbor graph of the given dataset to measure (1) how similar a pair of objects are and (2) how densely other objects are distributed between them. Via extensive experiments on sixteen synthetic and real-world datasets, we verify that replacing the existing similarity measure with our c-affinity improves the clustering accuracy significantly.": 0.1032056212425232

Recent advances have enabled the processing of vast amounts of data collected from these devices, using techniques from machine learning, statistical modeling, natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and others. The sheer volume of interactions has also made it possible to innovate and experiment continuously in a data-driven fashion, based on users’ interactions and feedback.

Topic modeling is a widely used technique for analyzing short text documents and uncovering the underlying topics. However, traditional topic models face difficulties in accurately extracting topics from short texts due to limited content and their sparse nature. To address these issues, we propose an Embedding-based topic modeling (EmTM) approach that incorporates word embedding and hierarchical clustering to identify significant topics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EmTM on two datasets comprising web short texts, Snippet and News. The results indicate a superiority of EmTM over baseline topic models by its exceptional performance in both classification accuracy and topic coherence metrics.": 0.1353551149368286,

Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks.

In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.": 0.13696503639221191

Sensor and online crowd-sourced data combined with machine learning methods have provided a recent breakthrough in poverty map inference. However, these methods do not capture local wealth fluctuations, and are not optimized to produce accountable results that guarantee accurate predictions to all sub-populations. Here, we propose a pipeline of machine learning models to infer the mean and standard deviation of wealth across multiple geographically clustered populated places, and illustrate their performance in Sierra Leone and Uganda. These models leverage seven independent and freely available feature sources based on satellite images, and metadata collected via online crowd-sourcing and social media. Our models show that combined metadata features are the best predictors of wealth in rural areas, outperforming image-based models, which are the best for predicting the highest wealth quintiles. Our results recover the local mean and variation of wealth, and correctly capture the positive yet non-monotonous correlation between them. We further demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of model transfer across countries and the effects of data recency and other biases. Our methodology provides open tools to build towards more transparent and interpretable models to help governments and NGOs to make informed decisions based on data availability, urbanization level, and poverty thresholds.": 0.15676504373550415

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines. Especially, our proposed KnowCL model can apply to both satellite and street imagery with both effectiveness and transferability achieved, which provides insights into urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction.": 0.13372021913528442,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_8>>abstract>>The widespread misinformation on the Web has raised many concerns with serious societal consequences. In this paper, we study a critical type of online misinformation, namely fauxtography, where the image and associated text of a social media post jointly convey a questionable or false sense. In particular, we focus on a sparse semi-supervised fauxtography detection problem, which aims to accurately identify fauxtography by only using the sparsely annotated ground truth labels of social media posts. Our problem is motivated by the key limitation of current fauxtography detection approaches that often require a large amount of expensive and inefficient manual annotations to train an effective fauxtography detection model. We identify two key technical challenges in solving the problem: 1) it is non-trivial to train an accurate detection model given the sparse fauxtography annotations, and 2) it is difficult to extract the heterogeneous and complicated fauxtography features from the multi-modal social media posts for accurate fauxtography detection. To address the above challenges, we propose ContrastFaux, a multi-view contrastive learning framework that jointly explores the sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multi-modal posts to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. Evaluation results on two social media datasets demonstrate that ContrastFaux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning fauxtography detection baselines by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy.": 0.12138164043426514

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_16>>abstract>>Social media platforms provide rich data sources in several domains. In mental health, individuals experiencing an Eating Disorder (ED) are often hesitant to seek help through conventional healthcare services. However, many people seek help with diet and body image issues on social media. To better distinguish at-risk users who may need help for an ED from those who are simply commenting on ED in social environments, highly sophisticated approaches are required. Assessment of ED risks in such a situation can be done in various ways, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hence, there is a need for and potential benefit of a more complex multimodal approach. To this end, we collect historical tweets, user biographies, and online behaviours of relevant users from Twitter, and generate a reasonably large labelled benchmark dataset. Thereafter, we develop an advanced multimodal deep learning model called EDNet using these data to identify the different types of users with ED engagement (e.g., potential ED sufferers, healthcare professionals, or communicators) and distinguish them from those not experiencing EDs on Twitter. EDNet consists of five deep neural network layers. With the help of its embedding, representation and behaviour modeling layers, it effectively learns the multimodalities of social media. In our experiments, EDNet consistently outperforms all the baseline techniques by significant margins. It achieves an accuracy of up to 94.32% and F1 score of up to 93.91% F1 score. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study to propose a multimodal approach for user-level classification according to their engagement with ED content on social media.": 0.11900854110717773,

Finding groups of nodes that form strongly stable agreements and participate in collective conflicts with other groups is an important problem in this context. Previous works approach this problem by finding balanced subgraphs, in which the polarity measure is optimized, that result in large subgraphs without a clear notion of agreement or conflict. In real-world signed networks, balanced subgraphs are often not polarized as in the case of a subgraph with only positive edges. To remedy this issue, we leverage the notion of cohesion — we find pairs of cohesively polarized communities where each node in a community is positively connected to nodes in the same community and negatively connected to nodes in the other community. To capture the cohesion along with the polarization, we define a new measure, dichotomy. We leverage the balanced triangles, which model the cohesion and polarization at the same time, to design a heuristic that results in good seedbeds for polarized communities in real-world signed networks. Then, we introduce the electron decomposition which finds cohesively polarized communities with high dichotomy score. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method finds cohesively polarized communities and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to several measures. Moreover, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing methods and practical for large-scale networks.": 0.1317155361175537,

At the same time, risk is highly contextualized, especially when it comes to media content youth share privately on social media. In this work, we conducted qualitative content analyses on risky media content flagged by youth participants and research assistants of similar ages to explore contextual dimensions of youth online risks. The contextual risk dimensions were then used to inform semi- and self-supervised state-of-the-art vision transformers to automate the process of identifying risky images shared by youth. We found that vision transformers are capable of learning complex image features for use in automated risk detection and classification.

Many modern e-commerce integrity systems utilize machine learning (ML) to detect fraud and bad actors. We discuss the practical problems faced by integrity systems which utilize data associated with user interactions with the platform. Specifically, we focus on the challenge of representing the user interaction events, and aggregating their features. We compare the performance of two paradigms to handle the feature temporality when training the ML models: hand-engineered temporal aggregation and a learned aggregation using a sequence encoder. We show that a model which learns a time-aggregation using a sequence encoder outperforms models trained on handcrafted aggregations on the fraud classification task with a real-world dataset.": 0.11252832412719727

To preserve the heterogeneous semantics on HINs, the rich node/edge types become a cornerstone of HIN representation learning. However, in real-world scenarios, type information is often noisy, missing or inaccessible. Assuming no type information is given, we define a so-called latent heterogeneous graph (LHG), which carries latent heterogeneous semantics as the node/edge types cannot be observed. In this paper, we study the challenging and unexplored problem of link prediction on an LHG. As existing approaches depend heavily on type-based information, they are suboptimal or even inapplicable on LHGs. To address the absence of type information, we propose a model named LHGNN, based on the novel idea of semantic embedding at node and path levels, to capture latent semantics on and between nodes. We further design a personalization function to modulate the heterogeneous contexts conditioned on their latent semantics w.r.t. the target node, to enable finer-grained aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of LHGNN.": 0.12551069259643555

The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.": 0.08236843347549438,

For others, the authors have presented a potential solution, in particular, for considering dynamic values coming from external data sources into privacy policies.

It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). We implemented our approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric.": 0.13965469598770142,

Learning Analytics is the process of measuring, collecting, recording, and analysing this Student Activity Data. Predictive Learning Analytics, a sub-field of Learning Analytics, can help to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or failing, as well as students who are close to a grade boundary. Course tutors can use the insights provided by the analyses to offer timely assistance to these students. Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.": 0.12503129243850708

This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of the metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above problems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving features designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for metaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to participate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational power, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only protects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high computing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many studies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some of the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with unlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse and FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse technologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the Internet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality. Finally, we discuss some key challenges and promising directions of FL4M in detail. In summary, we hope that our up-to-date brief survey can help people better understand FL4M and build a fair, open, and secure metaverse.": 0.09738773107528687,

Because of this trend, community contribution-based, question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms became prominent for finding the proper solution to all programming issues. Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for technical-related questions for years. Still, recently, some programming-related subreddits of Reddit have become a standing stone for questions and discussions. This work investigates the developers’ behavior and community formation around the twenty most popular programming languages. We examined two consecutive years of programming-related questions from Stack Overflow and Reddit, performing a longitudinal study on users’ posting activity and their high-order interaction patterns abstracted via hypergraphs. Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&A platforms are utilized by their users. In line with previous literature, it emphasized the constant decline of Stack Overflow in favor of more community-friendly platforms, such as Reddit, which has been growing rapidly lately.": 0.1326693892478943,

This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text. Our experimental results on the TLS-Covid19 test collection demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.": 0.14084380865097046,

Given a user query, the retrieval phase returns a subset of candidate products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-specific pre-training model (referred to as MAKE) outperforms existing V+L pre-training methods on the text-to-multimodal retrieval task. MAKE has been deployed online and brings major improvements on the retrieval system of Taobao Search.": 0.16235005855560303

This challenge is exacerbated for new employees who need to develop workplace networks from the outset. In this paper, by analyzing a large-scale telemetry dataset of more than 10,000 Microsoft employees who joined the company in the first three months of 2022, we describe how new employees interact and telecommute with their colleagues during their “onboarding” period. Our results reveal that although new hires are gradually expanding networks over time, there still exists significant gaps between their network statistics and those of tenured employees even after the six-month onboarding phase. We also observe that heterogeneity exists among new employees in how their networks change over time, where employees whose job tasks do not necessarily require extensive and diverse connections could be at a disadvantaged position in this onboarding process. By investigating how web-based people recommendations in organizational knowledge base facilitate new employees naturally expand their networks, we also demonstrate the potential of web-based applications for addressing the aforementioned socialization challenges. Altogether, our findings provide insights on new employee network dynamics in remote and hybrid work environments, which may help guide organizational leaders and web application developers on quantifying and improving the socialization experiences of new employees in digital workplaces.": 0.16157829761505127

Research in this field has produced in many new approaches that generate data for specific tools and use cases. However, since a variety of tools are used and analytic tasks are performed in real analysis use cases there is a problem in building an interoperable baseline data corpus for investigation of the transferability of different approaches.

On the one hand, current centralized approaches are plagued by issues such as lack of privacy and control for users, high costs, and bad performance, making these approaches unsuitable for the decentralized data spaces prevalent in Europe and various industries (decentralized on the conceptual and physical levels while centralized in the underlying implementation). On the other hand, decentralized systems face challenges with limited knowledge of/control over the global system, fair resource utilization, and data provenance. Our proposed Semantic Data Ledger (SDL) approach combines the advantages of both architectures to overcome their limitations. SDL allows users to choose the best combination of centralized and decentralized features, providing a decentralized infrastructure for the publication of structured data with machine-readable semantics. It supports expressive structured queries, secure data sharing, and payment mechanisms based on an underlying autonomous ledger, enabling the implementation of economic models and fair-use strategies.": 0.13709455728530884,

Common reference dataspace architectures assume that sources publish their own domain-specific schema. These schemas, also known as semantic models, can only be partially created automatically and require oversight and refinement by human modellers. Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine.

Common reference dataspace architectures assume that sources publish their own domain-specific schema. These schemas, also known as semantic models, can only be partially created automatically and require oversight and refinement by human modellers. Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine. We discuss how PLASMA as a tool is suitable for building semantic models by non-expert users in the context of dataspaces and show some applications where PLASMA has already been used in data management projects.": 0.09278714656829834,

However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations.

To enable trustworthy machine creativity, we introduce the Harmonic Memory, a Knowledge Graph (KG) of harmonic patterns extracted from a large and heterogeneous musical corpus. By leveraging a cognitive model of tonal harmony, chord progressions are segmented into meaningful structures, and patterns emerge from their comparison via harmonic similarity. Akin to a music memory, the KG holds temporal connections between consecutive patterns, as well as salient similarity relationships. After demonstrating the validity of our choices, we provide examples of how this design enables novel pathways for combinational creativity.

Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods. We conclude with the transferability and robustness of our approach to identify creative harmful memes.": 0.07366055250167847,

We introduce CODER, a novel graph-based CODE Recommendation framework for open source software developers, which accounts for the complex interactions among multiple parties within the system. CODER jointly models microscopic user-code interactions and macroscopic user-project interactions via a heterogeneous graph and further bridges the two levels of information through aggregation on file-structure graphs that reflect the project hierarchy. Moreover, to overcome the lack of reliable benchmarks, we construct three large-scale datasets to facilitate future research in this direction.

However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent capability of improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations.

However, the interaction signal may not be sufficient to accurately characterize user interests and the low-pass filters may ignore the useful information contained in the high-frequency component of the observed signals, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To this end, we propose a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design the personalized graph signal containing richer user information and construct an augmented similarity graph containing more graph topology information, to more effectively characterize user interests. Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful information in the high-frequency components of the observed signals by combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the personalized graph signal, the augmented similarity graph and the mixed-frequency graph filter by proposing a pipeline consisting of three key steps: pre-processing, graph convolution and post-processing. Extensive experiments show that PGSP can achieve superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art CF methods and, as a nonparametric method, PGSP has very high training efficiency.": 0.11075097322463989,

While maintaining high competence in user modeling and next-item recommendation, these models have long been plagued by the numerous parameters and computation, which inhibit them to be deployed on resource-constrained mobile devices. Model quantization, as one of the main paradigms for compression techniques, converts float parameters to low-bit values to reduce parameter redundancy and accelerate inference. To avoid drastic performance degradation, it usually requests a fine-tuning phase with an original dataset. However, the training set of user-item interactions is not always available due to transmission limits or privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to quantize sequential recommenders without access to any real private data. A generator is employed in the framework to synthesize fake sequence samples to feed the quantized sequential recommendation model and minimize the gap with a full-precision sequential recommendation model. The generator and the quantized model are optimized with a min-max game — alternating discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer. Moreover, we devise a two-level discrepancy modeling strategy to transfer information between the quantized model and the full-precision model. The extensive experiments of various recommendation networks on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.": 0.16283732652664185

It motivates us to leverage the embedding normalization in recommendation. By normalizing user/item embeddings to a specific value, we empirically observe impressive performance gains (9% on average) on four real-world datasets. Although encouraging, we also reveal a serious limitation when applying normalization in recommendation — the performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the temperature τ which controls the scale of the normalized embeddings.": 0.13204026222229004,

We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses.

Initialisation with historical data is an example of data-driven regularisation which should, in theory, accelerate the convergence of CMABs. However, in practice, we have little to no control over the underlying generation process of such data, which may exhibit some pathologies, possibly impeding the convergence and the stability of the algorithm. In this paper, we focus on two main challenges: bias selection and data corruption. We propose two new algorithms to solve these specific issues: LinUCB with historical data and offline balancing (OB-HLinUCB) and Robust LinUCB with corrupted historical data (R-HLinUCB).

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_37>>abstract>>Improving user retention with reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted increasing attention due to its significant importance in boosting user engagement. However, training the RL policy from scratch without hurting users’ experience is unavoidable due to the requirement of trial-and-error searches. Furthermore, the offline methods, which aim to optimize the policy without online interactions, suffer from the notorious stability problem in value estimation or unbounded variance in counterfactual policy evaluation. To this end, we propose optimizing user retention with Decision Transformer (DT), which avoids the offline difficulty by translating the RL as an autoregressive problem. However, deploying the DT in recommendation is a non-trivial problem because of the following challenges: (1) deficiency in modeling the numerical reward value; (2) data discrepancy between the policy learning and recommendation generation; (3) unreliable offline performance evaluation. In this work, we, therefore, contribute a series of strategies for tackling the exposed issues. We first articulate an efficient reward prompt by weighted aggregation of meta embeddings for informative reward embedding. Then, we endow a weighted contrastive learning method to solve the discrepancy between training and inference. Furthermore, we design two robust offline metrics to measure user retention. Finally, the significant improvement in the benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_24>>abstract>>Collaborative filtering based recommendation learns users’ preferences from all users’ historical behavior data, and has been popular to facilitate decision making. Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does not perform equally well for different user groups according to users’ sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to improve fairness. Given each real original user-item interaction record, we propose the following hypotheses for augmenting the training data: each user in one group has a similar item preference (click or non-click) as the item preference of any user in the remaining group. With these hypotheses, we generate “fake\" interaction behaviors to complement the original training data. After that, we design a bi-level optimization target, with the inner optimization generates better fake data to augment training data with our hypotheses, and the outer one updates the recommendation model parameters based on the augmented training data. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FDA.": 0.112476646900177

To this purpose, we propose MERLIN, a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed to train Transformer-based language and visual models, along with graph neural network models, on collections of NFTs’ images and texts. A key aspect in MERLIN is its independence on financial features, as it exploits only the primary data a user interested in NFT trading would like to deal with, i.e., NFT images and textual descriptions. By learning dense representations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed by MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset has shown that MERLIN models achieve significant performances according to several financial assessment criteria, fostering profitable investments, and also beating baseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features.": 0.15575891733169556

Given a user query, the retrieval phase returns a subset of candidate products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-specific pre-training model (referred to as MAKE) outperforms existing V+L pre-training methods on the text-to-multimodal retrieval task. MAKE has been deployed online and brings major improvements on the retrieval system of Taobao Search.": 0.14892220497131348

For cloud-native applications, multiple containers collaborate to handle user requests, making each container’s workload changes influenced by workload group behavior. However, existing approaches mainly analyze the individual changes of each container and do not explicitly model the workload group evolution of containers, resulting in sub-optimal results. Therefore, we propose a workload prediction method, GROUP, which implements the shifts of workload prediction focus from individual to group, workload group behavior representation from data similarity to data correlation, and workload group behavior evolution from implicit modeling to explicit modeling. First, we model the workload group behavior and its evolution from multiple perspectives. Second, we propose a container correlation calculation algorithm that considers static and dynamic container information to represent the workload group behavior. Third, we propose an end-to-end multi-step-ahead prediction method that explicitly portrays the complex relationship between the evolution of workload group behavior and the workload changes of each container. Lastly, enough experiments on public datasets show the advantages of GROUP, which provides an effective solution to achieve workload prediction for cloud-native applications.": 0.15072667598724365,

For each user request, a few of the microservices are called, and a trace is formed to record the tree-like call dependencies among microservices and the time consumption at each call node. Traces are useful in diagnosing system failures, but their complex structures make it difficult to model their patterns and detect their anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-variable graph variational autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection on microservice traces. To reconstruct the time consumption of nodes, we propose a novel dispatching layer. We find that the inversion of negative log-likelihood (NLL) appears for some anomalous samples, which makes the anomaly score infeasible for anomaly detection. To address this, we point out that the NLL can be decomposed into KL-divergence and data entropy, whereas lower-dimensional anomalies can introduce an entropy gap with normal inputs. We propose three techniques to mitigate this entropy gap for trace anomaly detection: Bernoulli & Categorical Scaling, Node Count Normalization, and Gaussian Std-Limit. On five trace datasets from a top Internet company, our proposed TraceVAE achieves excellent F-scores.": 0.12801724672317505,

To reduce the traffic overheads incurred by FL systems, edge servers have been included between clients and the parameter server to aggregate clients’ local models. Recent studies on this edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme have focused on ensuring or accelerating model convergence by coping with various factors, e.g., uncertain network conditions, unreliable clients, heterogeneous compute resources, etc. This paper presents our three new discoveries of the edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme: 1) it wastes significant time during its two-phase training rounds; 2) it does not recognize or utilize model diversity when producing a global model; and 3) it is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose FedEdge, a novel edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme that accelerates model training with asynchronous local federated training and adaptive model aggregation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used public datasets. The results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art FL schemes, FedEdge accelerates model convergence by 1.14 × −3.20 ×, and improves model accuracy by 2.14% - 6.63%.": 0.14542049169540405,

It allows the cloud service provider to sell more resources than the physical limit, assuming not all users would fully utilize the resources simultaneously. However, how to design an oversubscription policy that improves utilization while satisfying some safety constraints remains an open problem. Existing methods and industrial practices are over-conservative, ignoring the coordination of diverse resource usage patterns and probabilistic constraints. To address these two limitations, this paper formulates the oversubscription for cloud as a chance-constrained optimization problem and proposes an effective Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (C2MARL) method to solve this problem. Specifically, C2MARL reduces the number of constraints by considering their upper bounds and leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm to learn a safe and optimal coordination policy. We evaluate our C2MARL on an internal cloud platform and public cloud datasets. Experiments show that our C2MARL outperforms existing methods in improving utilization () under different levels of safety constraints.": 0.1319817304611206

Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.": 0.09261655807495117,

Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM) is the task of finding useful patterns that statistically occur more often from databases for one class than for another. The existing SSPM task does not consider the weight of each item. While in the real world, the significant level of different items/objects is various. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Weighted Statistically Significant Patterns Mining (WSSPM) problem and propose a novel WSSpm algorithm to successfully solve it. We present a new framework that effectively mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. We also propose a new weighted support threshold that can satisfy the demand of WSSPM and prove its correctness and completeness. Besides, our weighted support threshold and modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range.

Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect).

Its main objectives are to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. For this, research published at TempWeb covers (and has covered in its previous editions) the full spectrum of longitudinal studies using web content. This ranges from “low-level” network analysis (e.g., Internet traffic) and graph analysis (e.g., in social media) up to “high-level” content and concept analysis ranging from micro-content (e.g., tweets) up to entire web archives. As such, TempWeb has become a potential object of longitudinal studies on its own. Aiming at the investigation of infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Web scale, TempWeb has developed as a forum for a community from science and industry. Since longitudinal aspects in web content analysis is becoming more and more relevant for analysts from various domains, the studies, tools, and demonstrations are not only relevant for computer science, but also potentially interesting for sociology, marketing, environmental studies, politics, etc. Keeping up with its “tradition”, the current edition covers again the full spectrum of temporal Web analytics at various levels of granularity.": 0.08803021907806396,

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the situations that arouse out of the pandemic were so incongruous to the world we knew that even factual statements often had a humorous reaction. In this paper, we present a dataset of 2510 samples hand-annotated with labels such as humor style, type, theme, target and stereotypes formed or exploited while creating the humor in addition to 909 memes. Our dataset comprises Reddit posts, comments, Onion news headlines, real news headlines, and tweets. We evaluate the task of humor detection and maladaptive humor detection on state-of-the-art models namely RoBERTa and GPT-3. The finetuned models trained on our dataset show significant gains over zero-shot models including GPT-3 when detecting humor. Even though GPT-3 is good at generating meaningful explanations, we observed that it fails to detect maladaptive humor due to the absence of overt targets and profanities. We believe that the presented dataset will be helpful in designing computational methods for topical humor processing as it provides a unique sample set to study the theory of incongruity in a post-pandemic world. The data is available to research community at https://github.com/smritae01/Covid19_Humor.": 0.15414345264434814

The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. In this work, we conduct a case study approaching this problem with semi-supervised learning using a large language model (LLM). We select Reddit as the target social media platform due to its broad coverage of topics and content types. Our pipeline first generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while training the student model using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.": 0.1341293454170227,

One such structure, the Ego Network Model (ENM), has been found almost ubiquitously in human society. Recently, this model has been extended to include signed connections. While the unsigned ENM has been rigorously observed for decades, the signed version is still somewhat novel and lacks the same breadth of observation. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to examine this signed structure across various categories of individuals from a swathe of culturally distinct regions. Minor differences in the distribution of signs across the SENM can be observed between cultures. However, these can be overwhelmed when the network is centred around a specific topic. Indeed, users who are engaged with specific themes display higher levels of negativity in their networks. This effect is further supported by a significant negative correlation between the number of \"general\" topics discussed in a network and that network’s percentage of negative connections. These findings suggest that the negativity of communications and relationships on Twitter are very dependent on the topics being discussed and, furthermore, these relationships are more likely to be negative when they are based around a specific topic.": 0.1384028196334839,

Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks. Due to the deluge of such messages on social media, and their tremendous power to shape our perceptions, there has never been a greater need to automate these analyses, which play a pivotal role in fact-checking, opinion mining, understanding opinion trends, and other such downstream tasks of social consequence. In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.": 0.14984077215194702

To ensure consistent model performance and account for variations in data distribution, regular retraining is necessary. This paper introduces a solution for improving online customer service in e-commerce by presenting a universal model for predicting labels based on customer questions, without requiring training. Our novel approach involves using machine learning techniques to tag customer questions in transcripts and create a repository of questions and corresponding labels. When a customer requests assistance, an information retrieval model searches the repository for similar questions, and statistical analysis is used to predict the corresponding label. By eliminating the need for individual model training and maintenance, our approach reduces both the model development cycle and costs. The repository only requires periodic updating to maintain accuracy.": 0.10780268907546997

Most of the existing BFMs concentrate on maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint, which is insufficient for many applications with complex objectives or constraints. Observing this, the recent studies (e.g., [4, 5, 11]) have considered non-monotone submodular objectives or more complex constraints such as a k-system constraint. In this study, we follow this line of research and propose truthful BFMs with improved performance bounds for non-monotone submodular objectives with or without a k-system constraint. Our BFMs leverage the idea of providing random prices to users while deferring the decision on the final winning set, and are also based on a novel randomized algorithm for the canonical constrained submodular maximization problem achieving better performance bounds compared to the state-of-the-art.

First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale.": 0.15545058250427246

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_10>>abstract>>Advertisers in online ad auctions are increasingly using auto-bidding mechanisms to bid into auctions instead of directly bidding their value manually. One of the prominent auto-bidding formats is that of target cost-per-acquisition (tCPA) which maximizes the volume of conversions subject to a return-of-investment constraint. From an auction theoretic perspective however, this trend seems to go against foundational results that postulate that for profit-maximizing (aka quasi-linear) bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like marginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA.": 0.12424641847610474,

The crux of the argument lies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first the auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA or mCPA bidding format (and submit bids accordingly); and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can revisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending on the bids submitted by the bidders). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format compared to the classic mCPA format.": 0.12712430953979492,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_13>>abstract>>In this work, we investigate the problem of how to bid in repeated contextual first price auctions for a single learner (the bidder). Concretely, at each time t, the learner receives a context and decides the bid based on historical information and xt. We assume that the maximum bid of all the others follows a linear model, i.e., mt = ⟨α0, xt⟩ + zt, where is unknown to the learner and zt is randomly sampled from a noise distribution with log-concave density. In this work, we consider both binary feedback (the learner can only observe whether she wins or not) and full information feedback (the learner can observe mt) models of the learner. For binary feedback, when the noise distribution is (partially) known, we propose a bidding algorithm that achieves at most regret, where Δ is a constant reserve in first price auctions.1 For the full information feedback with unknown noise distribution, we provide an algorithm that achieves regret at most . Our approach combines an estimator for log-concave density functions and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to learn the noise distribution and linear weight α0 simultaneously. We complement our results with a lower bound result such that any bidding policy in a broad class must achieve regret at least , even when the learner receives the full information feedback and is known.": 0.09234756231307983,

However, existing detection methods in the audio area exclusively work in English, and there is a lack of data resources in other languages. Cross-lingual deepfake detection, a critical but rarely explored area, urges more study. This paper conducts the first comprehensive study on the cross-lingual perspective of deepfake detection. We observe that English data enriched in deepfake algorithms can teach a detector the knowledge of various spoofing artifacts, contributing to performing detection across language domains. Based on the observation, we first construct a first-of-its-kind cross-lingual evaluation dataset including heterogeneous spoofed speech uttered in the two most widely spoken languages, then explored domain adaptation (DA) techniques to transfer the artifacts detection capability and propose effective and practical DA strategies fitting the cross-lingual scenario. Our adversarial-based DA paradigm teaches the model to learn real/fake knowledge while losing language dependency. Extensive experiments over 137-hour audio clips validate the adapted models can detect fake audio generated by unseen algorithms in the new domain.": 0.10097414255142212,

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.": 0.1274878978729248

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_40>>abstract>>In recent years, seeking health information on the web has become a preferred way for healthcare consumers to support their information needs. Generally, healthcare consumers use long and detailed questions with several peripheral details to express their healthcare concerns, contributing to natural language understanding challenges. One way to address this challenge is by summarizing the questions. However, most of the existing abstractive summarization systems generate impeccably fluent yet factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary. Our extensive experimental results on two benchmark consumer health question summarization datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method by achieving state-of-the-art performance and generating factually correct and fluent summaries, as measured by human evaluation.": 0.1177835464477539,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_23>>abstract>>Entity alignment (EA) aims to identify equivalent entities between knowledge graphs (KGs), which is a key technique to improve the coverage of existing KGs. Current EA models largely ignore the importance of time information contained in KGs and treat relational facts or attribute values of entities as time-invariant. However, real-world entities could evolve over time, making the knowledge of the aligned entities very different in multiple KGs. This may cause incorrect matching between KGs if such entity dynamics is ignored. In this paper, we propose a time-aware entity alignment (TEA) model that discovers the entity evolving behaviour by exploring the time contexts in KGs and aggregates various contextual information to make the alignment decision. In particular, we address two main challenges in the TEA model: 1) How to identify highly-correlated temporal facts; 2) How to capture entity dynamics and incorporate it to learn a more informative entity representation for the alignment task. Experiments on real-world datasets1 verify the superiority of our TEA model over state-of-the-art entity aligners.": 0.15855318307876587

For example, in toxic language detection, comments targeting different demographic groups can vary markedly across groups. In such settings, trained models can be dominated by the relationships that best fit the majority group, leading to disparate performance. We propose framing toxicity detection as multi-task learning (MTL), allowing a model to specialize on the relationships that are relevant to each demographic group while also leveraging shared properties across groups. With toxicity detection, each task corresponds to identifying toxicity against a particular demographic group. However, traditional MTL requires labels for all tasks to be present for every data point. To address this, we propose Conditional MTL (CondMTL), wherein only training examples relevant to the given demographic group are considered by the loss function. This lets us learn group specific representations in each branch which are not cross contaminated by irrelevant labels. Results on synthetic and real data show that using CondMTL improves predictive recall over various baselines in general and for the minority demographic group in particular, while having similar overall accuracy.": 0.13928180932998657

According to the explorer, we find that more than 75% of slashable Byzantine actions were not slashed. Since Ethereum relies on the “stake-and-slash\" mechanism to align incentives, this finding would at its face value cause concern over Ethereum’s security. However, further investigation reveals that all the apparent unslashed incidents were erroneously recorded due to the explorer’s mishandling of consensus edge cases.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving.

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment. Finally, we analyze token smart contracts to identify mechanisms that can hinder sniper bots.": 0.11509841680526733,

Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.": 0.13850796222686768

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing.

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems.": 0.1116977334022522

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week_5>>abstract>>Organisations have to comply with environmental regulations to protect the environment and meet internationally agreed climate change targets. To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential.": 0.10829168558120728,

However, variants of graph neural architectures can lead to drastically different performance on different tasks. Model comparison calls for a unifying framework with interpretability and principled experimental procedures. Based on the theories from graph signal processing (GSP), we show that GCN’s capability is fundamentally limited by the uncertainty principle, and wavelets provide a controllable trade-off between local and global information. We adapt wavelet denoising filters to the graph domain, unifying popular variants of GCN under a common interpretable mathematical framework. Furthermore, we propose WaveThresh and WaveShrink which are novel GCN models based on proven denoising filters from the signal processing literature. Empirically, we evaluate our models and other popular GCNs under a more principled procedure and analyze how trade-offs between local and global graph signals can lead to better performance in different datasets.": 0.13045400381088257,

Due to its high efficiency, Proof of Authority (PoA) Aura has become one of the most widely adopted consensus solutions for blockchains. Our research finds over 4,000 projects have used Aura and its variants. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of Aura. We propose three types of time-manipulation attacks, where a malicious leader simply needs to modify the timestamp in its proposed block or delay it to extract extra benefits. These attacks can easily break the legal leader election, thus directly harming the fairness of the block proposal. We apply our attacks to a mature Aura project called OpenEthereum. By repeatedly conducting our attacks1 over 15 days, we find that an adversary can gain on average 200% mining rewards of their fair shares. Furthermore, such attacks can even indirectly break the finality of blocks and the safety of the system. Based on the deployment of Aura as of September 2022, the potentially affected market cap is up to 2.13 billion USD. As a by-product, we further discuss solutions to mitigate such issues and report our observations to official teams.": 0.16413557529449463,

Due to the accelerating rate of research publication, together with the recognised benefits of interdisciplinary research, systems that facilitate researchers in discovering and understanding relevant works from beyond their immediate school of knowledge are vital. This work explores different methods of research paper representation (or document embedding), to identify those methods that are capable of preserving the interdisciplinary implications of research papers in their embeddings. In addition to evaluating state of the art methods of document embedding in a interdisciplinary citation prediction task, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network architecture designed to preserve the key interdisciplinary implications of research articles in citation network node embeddings.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_10>>abstract>>The wide popularity of short videos on social media poses new opportunities and challenges to optimize recommender systems on the video-sharing platforms. Users sequentially interact with the system and provide complex and multi-faceted responses, including WatchTime  and various types of interactions with multiple videos. On the one hand, the platforms aim at optimizing the users’ cumulative WatchTime  (main goal) in the long term, which can be effectively optimized by Reinforcement Learning. On the other hand, the platforms also need to satisfy the constraint of accommodating the responses of multiple user interactions (auxiliary goals) such as Like, Follow, Share, etc. In this paper, we formulate the problem of short video recommendation as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We find that traditional constrained reinforcement learning algorithms fail to work well in this setting. We propose a novel two-stage constrained actor-critic method: At stage one, we learn individual policies to optimize each auxiliary signal. In stage two, we learn a policy to (i) optimize the main signal and (ii) stay close to policies learned in the first stage, which effectively guarantees the performance of this main policy on the auxiliaries. Through extensive offline evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over alternatives in both optimizing the main goal as well as balancing the others. We further show the advantage of our method in live experiments of short video recommendations, where it significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of both WatchTime  and interactions. Our approach has been fully launched in the production system to optimize user experiences on the platform.": 0.19549912214279175
