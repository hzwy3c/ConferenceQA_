These mechanisms, however, assume that agents' strategies are task-independent, meaning an agent's report on a task is not influenced by their information about other tasks."}, {"query": "What is the process of reviewing the submitted papers?", "output": "The process of reviewing the submitted papers involves several steps:\n\n1.

The papers are then ranked based on several factors, including technical merit, originality, potential impact, the quality of execution and presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics.\n\n4. A Senior Program Committee (SPC) member provides a summary (“meta review”) and oversees each submission and its review.\n\n5. Track Chairs (TC) for each track review the paper for fitness to the conference and track, formatting, and page limits. They also have the authority to reject papers that do not clearly position themselves within the scope of the conference and track or do not meet formatting requirements."}]
