However, user interacting with an item may also due to conformity, the need to follow popular items. Most previous studies neglect user’s conformity and entangle interest with it, which may cause the recommender systems fail to provide satisfying results. Therefore, from the cause-effect view, disentangling these interaction causes is a crucial issue. It also contributes to OOD problems, where training and test data are out-of-distribution. Nevertheless, it is quite challenging as we lack the signal to differentiate interest and conformity. The data sparsity of pure cause and the items’ long-tail problem hinder disentangled causal embedding. In this paper, we propose DCCL, a framework that adopts contrastive learning to disentangle these two causes by sample augmentation for interest and conformity respectively. Futhermore, DCCL is model-agnostic, which can be easily deployed in any industrial online system. Extensive experiments are conducted over two real-world datasets and DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on top of various backbone models in various OOD environments.

The order in which posts, videos, messages, comments, ads, used products, notifications are presented to a user greatly affects the time spent on the platform, how often they visit it, how much they interact with each other, and the quantity and quality of the content they post. To this end, item ranking algorithms use models that predict the likelihood of different events, e.g., the user liking, sharing, commenting on a video, clicking/converting on an ad, or opening the platform’s app from a notification. Unfortunately, by solely relying on such event-prediction models, social media platforms tend to over optimize for short-term objectives and ignore the long-term effects. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at improving item ranking long-term impact. The approach primarily relies on an ML model that predicts negative user experiences. The model utilizes all available UI events: the details of an action can reveal how positive or negative the user experience has been; for example, a user writing a lengthy report asking for a given video to be taken down, likely had a very negative experience. Furthermore, the model takes into account detected integrity (e.g., hostile speech or graphic violence) and quality (e.g., click or engagement bait) issues with the content. Note that those issues can be perceived very differently from different users. Therefore, developing a personalized model, where a prediction refers to a specific user for a specific piece of content at a specific point in time, is a fundamental design choice in our approach. Besides the personalized ML model, our approach consists of two more pieces: (a) the way the personalized model is integrated with an item ranking algorithm and (b) the metrics, methodology, and success criteria for the long term impact of detecting and limiting negative user experiences. Our evaluation process uses extensive A/B testing on the Facebook platform: we compare the impact of our approach in treatment groups against production control groups. The AB test results indicate a 5% to 50% reduction in hides, reports, and submitted feedback. Furthermore, we compare against a baseline that does not include some of the crucial elements of our approach: the comparison shows our approach has a 100x to 30x lower False Positive Ratio than a baseline. Lastly, we present the results from a large scale survey, where we observe a statistically significant improvement of 3 to 6 percent in users’ sentiment regarding content suffering from nudity, clickbait, false / misleading, witnessing-hate, and violence issues.", "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_23>>abstract>>Sequential recommender models are essential components of modern industrial recommender systems. These models learn to predict the next items a user is likely to interact with based on his/her interaction history on the platform. Most sequential recommenders however lack a higher-level understanding of user intents, which often drive user behaviors online. Intent modeling is thus critical for understanding users and optimizing long-term user experience. We propose a probabilistic modeling approach and formulate user intent as latent variables, which are inferred based on user behavior signals using variational autoencoders (VAE). The recommendation policy is then adjusted accordingly given the inferred user intent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the latent user intent modeling via offline analyses as well as live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommendation platform."], "from": "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>ACM Policy>>Ethics", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

Furthermore, the model takes into account detected integrity (e.g., hostile speech or graphic violence) and quality (e.g., click or engagement bait) issues with the content. Note that those issues can be perceived very differently from different users. Therefore, developing a personalized model, where a prediction refers to a specific user for a specific piece of content at a specific point in time, is a fundamental design choice in our approach. Besides the personalized ML model, our approach consists of two more pieces: (a) the way the personalized model is integrated with an item ranking algorithm and (b) the metrics, methodology, and success criteria for the long term impact of detecting and limiting negative user experiences. Our evaluation process uses extensive A/B testing on the Facebook platform: we compare the impact of our approach in treatment groups against production control groups. The AB test results indicate a 5% to 50% reduction in hides, reports, and submitted feedback. Furthermore, we compare against a baseline that does not include some of the crucial elements of our approach: the comparison shows our approach has a 100x to 30x lower False Positive Ratio than a baseline. Lastly, we present the results from a large scale survey, where we observe a statistically significant improvement of 3 to 6 percent in users’ sentiment regarding content suffering from nudity, clickbait, false / misleading, witnessing-hate, and violence issues.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_23>>abstract>>Sequential recommender models are essential components of modern industrial recommender systems. These models learn to predict the next items a user is likely to interact with based on his/her interaction history on the platform. Most sequential recommenders however lack a higher-level understanding of user intents, which often drive user behaviors online. Intent modeling is thus critical for understanding users and optimizing long-term user experience. We propose a probabilistic modeling approach and formulate user intent as latent variables, which are inferred based on user behavior signals using variational autoencoders (VAE). The recommendation policy is then adjusted accordingly given the inferred user intent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the latent user intent modeling via offline analyses as well as live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommendation platform.\n\nQuestion:What are the expected behaviors for participants according to the ACM Policy?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The ACM Policy expects participants to avoid any form of abusive action, discrimination such as racism and homophobia, and sexual harassment.

A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.\n\nWWW2023>>Program>>Keynotes>>Keynotes_1>>bio>>Dr. Barbara Poblete is an Associate Professor at the Computer Science Departmentof(http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/) the University of Chile and an Amazon(https://www.amazon.science/) Visiting Academic at Alexa Shopping Research.

In this work, we first conduct data analysis from a graph view to observe that the users’ feedback is restricted to limited items, verifying the phenomenon of centralized recommendation.

Estimating the embodied carbon in products is a key step towards understanding their impact, and undertaking mitigation actions. Precise carbon attribution is challenging at scale, requiring both domain expertise and granular supply chain data. As a first-order approximation, standard reports use Economic Input-Output based Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) which estimates carbon emissions per dollar at an industry sector level using transactions between different parts of the economy. EIO-LCA models map products to an industry sector, and uses the corresponding carbon per dollar estimates to calculate the embodied carbon footprint of a product. An LCA expert needs to map each product to one of upwards of 1000 potential industry sectors. To reduce the annotation burden, the standard practice is to group products by categories, and map categories to their corresponding industry sector. We present CaML, an algorithm to automate EIO-LCA using semantic text similarity matching by leveraging the text descriptions of the product and the industry sector. CaML uses a pre-trained sentence transformer model to rank the top-5 matches, and asks a human to check if any of them are a good match. We annotated 40K products with non-experts. Our results reveal that pre-defined product categories are heterogeneous with respect to EIO-LCA industry sectors, and lead to a large mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 51% in kgCO2e/$. CaML outperforms the previous manually intensive method, yielding a MAPE of 22% with no domain labels (zero-shot). We compared annotations of a small sample of 210 products with LCA experts, and find that CaML accuracy is comparable to that of annotations by non-experts.", "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_9>>abstract>>State-of-the-art ZKP mixers are moreover interwoven with the DeFi ecosystem by offering anonymity mining (AM) incentives, i.e., users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins.

Our findings indicate that AM attracts privacy-ignorant users, who then do not contribute to improving the privacy of other mixer users.", "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_5>>abstract>>The expanding accessibility and appeal of investing have attracted millions of new retail investors. As such, investment discussion boards became the de facto communities where traders create, disseminate, and discuss investing ideas. These communities, which can provide useful information to support investors, have anecdotally also attracted a wide range of misbehavior – toxicity, spam/fraud, and reputation manipulation. This paper is the first comprehensive analysis of online misbehavior in the context of investment communities. We study TradingView, the largest online communication platform for financial trading. We collect 2.76M user profiles with their corresponding social graphs, 4.2M historical article posts, and 5.3M comments, including information on nearly 4 000 suspended accounts and 17 000 removed comments.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving. Understanding the global landscape surrounding tax evasion opportunities in decentralized finance represents a first step at preventing corporate capital flight of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_8>>abstract>>Further, ZKP mixers advertise their level of privacy through a so-called anonymity set size, which similarly to k-anonymity allows a user to hide among a set of k other users. Through empirical measurements, we, however, find that these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate. For the most popular mixers on Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), we show how to reduce the anonymity set size on average by and respectively. Our empirical evidence is also the first to suggest a differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_9>>abstract>>Products contribute to carbon emissions in each phase of their life cycle, from manufacturing to disposal. Estimating the embodied carbon in products is a key step towards understanding their impact, and undertaking mitigation actions. Precise carbon attribution is challenging at scale, requiring both domain expertise and granular supply chain data. As a first-order approximation, standard reports use Economic Input-Output based Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) which estimates carbon emissions per dollar at an industry sector level using transactions between different parts of the economy. EIO-LCA models map products to an industry sector, and uses the corresponding carbon per dollar estimates to calculate the embodied carbon footprint of a product. An LCA expert needs to map each product to one of upwards of 1000 potential industry sectors. To reduce the annotation burden, the standard practice is to group products by categories, and map categories to their corresponding industry sector. We present CaML, an algorithm to automate EIO-LCA using semantic text similarity matching by leveraging the text descriptions of the product and the industry sector. CaML uses a pre-trained sentence transformer model to rank the top-5 matches, and asks a human to check if any of them are a good match. We annotated 40K products with non-experts. Our results reveal that pre-defined product categories are heterogeneous with respect to EIO-LCA industry sectors, and lead to a large mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 51% in kgCO2e/$. CaML outperforms the previous manually intensive method, yielding a MAPE of 22% with no domain labels (zero-shot). We compared annotations of a small sample of 210 products with LCA experts, and find that CaML accuracy is comparable to that of annotations by non-experts.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_9>>abstract>>State-of-the-art ZKP mixers are moreover interwoven with the DeFi ecosystem by offering anonymity mining (AM) incentives, i.e., users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the claims of related work, we find that AM does not necessarily improve the quality of a mixer’s anonymity set. Our findings indicate that AM attracts privacy-ignorant users, who then do not contribute to improving the privacy of other mixer users.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_5>>abstract>>The expanding accessibility and appeal of investing have attracted millions of new retail investors. As such, investment discussion boards became the de facto communities where traders create, disseminate, and discuss investing ideas. These communities, which can provide useful information to support investors, have anecdotally also attracted a wide range of misbehavior – toxicity, spam/fraud, and reputation manipulation. This paper is the first comprehensive analysis of online misbehavior in the context of investment communities. We study TradingView, the largest online communication platform for financial trading. We collect 2.76M user profiles with their corresponding social graphs, 4.2M historical article posts, and 5.3M comments, including information on nearly 4 000 suspended accounts and 17 000 removed comments. Price fluctuations seem to drive abuse across the platform and certain types of assets, such as “meme” stocks, attract disproportionate misbehavior. Suspended user accounts tend to form more closely-knit communities than those formed by non-suspended accounts; and paying accounts are less likely to be suspended than free accounts even when posting similar levels of content violating platform policies. We conclude by offering guidelines on how to adapt content moderation efforts to fit the particularities of online investment communities.\n\nQuestion:What is the average difference in registration fees between ACM members and non-ACM members?\nAnswer:", "gt": "$178.5", "response": "I don't know the answer to that question as the provided text does not provide that information."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "How many times the cost of the virtual conference would a student have to pay if they register for the main conference during the Standard period?", "retrieve_results": ["WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Tue May 02>>Tue May 02_15>>subsessions>>subsessions_1>>subsession>>2688-Learning Cooperative Oversubscription for Cloud by Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_308>>title>>CgAT: Center-Guided Adversarial Training for Deep Hashing-Based Retrieval", "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_12>>subsessions>>subsessions_5>>subsession>>9228-Near-Optimal Experimental Design Under the Budget Constraint in Online Platforms", "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_4>>title>>Task Adaptive Multi-learner Network for Joint CTR and CVR Estimation", "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_7>>title>>Learning Cooperative Oversubscription for Cloud by Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"], "from": "WWW2023/Attendees/Registration/Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
