In 2022 this conference became The ACM Web Conference.\nThe 2023 edition of this conference is therefore the 32nd in the series and takes place on the 33rd anniversary of the Web.\nDuring this period, access to the Web and its applications have become widely available around the world and many new technologies have emerged. The evolution of the Web has been marked not only by great technological advances, but also by anecdotal events that have contributed to build the Web that we know today.\nAfter more than thirty years, it is time to keep track of all these events, so we invite all those who participated in this collective adventure to share the information they have. We also invite those whose field of technical, sociological, or philosophical research concerns the evolution or the impact of the Web to submit their work.": 0.09703046083450317}, "What is the purpose of the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Home>>name>>WWW2023": 0.092723548412323, "WWW2023>>Home>>full name>>The Web Conference": 0.10293936729431152, "WWW2023>>Home>>location>>Austin, Texas, US.
