For delivery systems, improving address resolution positively impacts multiple downstream systems such as geocoding, route planning and delivery time estimations, leading to an efficient and reliable delivery experience, both for customers as well as delivery agents. Our proposed approach jointly leverages address text, past delivery information and concepts from graph theory to retrieve informative and diverse record pairs to label. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach on manually curated dataset across addresses from India (IN) and United Arab Emirates (UAE). We achieved absolute improvement in recall on average across IN and UAE while preserving precision over the existing production system. We also introduce delivery point (DP) geocode learning for cold-start addresses as a downstream application of address resolution. In addition to offline evaluation, we also performed online A/B experiments which show that when the production model is augmented with active learnt record pairs, the delivery precision improved by and delivery defects reduced by on an average across shipments from IN and UAE.": 0.12578946352005005}, "Which study presents a new method for contrastive fine-tuning on few shot intent detection within a topological intent tree?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_12>>abstract>>Continual few-shot learning, as a paradigm that simultaneously solves continual learning and few-shot learning, has become a challenging problem in machine learning. An eligible continual few-shot learning model is expected to distinguish all seen classes upon new categories arriving, where each category only includes very few labeled data. However, existing continual few-shot learning methods only consider the visual modality, where the distributions of new categories often indistinguishably overlap with old categories, thus resulting in the severe catastrophic forgetting problem. To tackle this problem, in this paper we study continual few-shot learning with the assistance of semantic knowledge by simultaneously taking both visual modality and semantic concepts of categories into account. We propose a Continual few-shot learning algorithm with Semantic knowledge Regularization (CoSR) for adapting to the distribution changes of visual prototypes through a Transformer-based prototype adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the original visual prototypes from the backbone are fed into the well-designed Transformer with corresponding semantic concepts, where the semantic concepts are extracted from all categories. The semantic-level regularization forces the categories with similar semantics to be closely distributed, while the opposite ones are constrained to be far away from each other. The semantic regularization improves the model’s ability to distinguish between new and old categories, thus significantly mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, CUB200 and an industrial dataset with long-tail distribution demonstrate the advantages of our CoSR model compared with state-of-the-art methods.": 0.15098661184310913}, "Which study presents an end-to-end optimization solution for Facebook Marketplace Search engine?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_2>>abstract>>Query categorization at customer-to-customer e-commerce platforms like Facebook Marketplace is challenging due to the vagueness of search intent, noise in real-world data, and imbalanced training data across languages. Its deployment also needs to consider challenges in scalability and downstream integration in order to translate modeling advances into better search result relevance. In this paper we present HierCat, the query categorization system at Facebook Marketplace. HierCat addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-task pre-training of dual-encoder architectures with a hierarchical inference step to effectively learn from weakly supervised training data mined from searcher engagement. We show that HierCat not only outperforms popular methods in offline experiments, but also leads to 1.4% improvement in NDCG and 4.3% increase in searcher engagement at Facebook Marketplace Search in

When I say “suddenly” I refer to the Internet’s birthday, October 29, 1969 and how two thirds of the human race, five billion people, are already on the Internet, in only 50 years. Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype.

platforms is to enable content discovery, i.e. allow users to find a catalog entity they were not familiar with. A pre-requisite to discover an entity, e.g. a book, with a search engine is that the entity is retrievable, i.e. there are queries for which the system will surface such entity in the top results. However, machine-learned search engines have a high retrievability bias, where the majority of the queries return the same entities. This happens partly due to the predominance of narrow intent queries, where users create queries using the title of an already known entity, e.g. in book search “harry potter”. The amount of broad queries where users want to discover new entities, e.g. in music search “chill lyrical electronica with an atmospheric feeling to it”, and have a higher tolerance to what they might find, is small in comparison. We focus here on two factors that have a negative impact on the retrievability of the entities (I) the training data used for dense retrieval models and (II) the distribution of narrow and broad intent queries issued in the system. We propose CtrlQGen, a method that generates queries for a chosen underlying intent—narrow or broad. We can use CtrlQGen to improve factor (I) by generating training data for dense retrieval models comprised of diverse synthetic queries. CtrlQGen can also be used to deal with factor (II) by suggesting queries with broader intents to users. Our results on datasets from the domains of music, podcasts, and books reveal that we can significantly decrease the retrievability bias of a dense retrieval model when using CtrlQGen. First, by using the generated queries as training data for dense models we make 9% of the entities retrievable—go from zero to non-zero retrievability. Second, by suggesting broader queries to users, we can make 12% of the entities retrievable in the best case.": 0.12208795547485352}, "What is the proposed solution in 'Zero-shot Clarifying Question Generation for Conversational Search'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_15>>abstract>>A long-standing challenge for search and conversational assistants is query intention detection in ambiguous queries.

Offline evaluations and online A/B test experiments show DeepPvisit outperforms the existing survival regression model and the other baseline models and delivers better business metrics online.": 0.19485223293304443}, "Who proposed a new algorithm that incorporates the ontology of knowledge graphs for large-scale training?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_4>>authors>>authors_2>>Tomer Sagi": 0.1419087052345276, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_4>>authors>>authors_3>>Katja Hose": 0.15365970134735107, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_4>>authors>>authors_1>>Antonio Zaitoun": 0.1569773554801941, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_2>>abstract>>Over recent years, large knowledge bases have been constructed to store massive knowledge graphs. However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.": 0.15716218948364258}, "What is the problem that Gian Marco Bovenzi's research on criminal accountability for conducts in the Metaverse attempts to explore?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_3>>abstract>>The research addresses a topic whose precise boundaries are yet to be defined: the criminal accountability for conducts committed in the Metaverse. Following a short introduction motivating the reason why this issue has to be considered as pivotal both for the Web and for the society, the main problem raised by the research will be identified, namely, whether an action taken against a person, that in real-life would be a criminal conduct, is considerable as a crime in the Metaverse as well. A short assessment of the (very little so far) current state of the art, as well as the proposed approach and methodology will be then overviewed; finally, the contribution shows its current results, and concludes stating that countries are highly encouraged to shape respective criminal frameworks when applied to the Metaverse, and that the international community should consider the topic as a priority in its agenda.

A typical approach collects nodes relevant to the QA pair from a KG to form a Working Graph (WG) followed by reasoning using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This faces two major challenges: (i) it is difficult to capture all the information from the QA in the WG, and (ii) the WG contains some irrelevant nodes from the KG. To address these, we propose GrapeQA with two simple improvements on the WG: (i) Prominent Entities for Graph Augmentation identifies relevant text chunks from the QA pair and augments the WG with corresponding latent representations from the LM, and (ii) Context-Aware Node Pruning removes nodes that are less relevant to the QA pair. We evaluate our results on OpenBookQA, CommonsenseQA and MedQA-USMLE and see that GrapeQA shows consistent improvements over its LM + KG predecessor (QA-GNN in particular) and large improvements on OpenBookQA.": 0.17331624031066895}, "What are the roles of Liane Lewin-Eytan, Suzan Verberne, and Michael Bendersky in The Web Conference (WWW2023) Search Track?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>name>>Michael Bendersky": 0.1277419924736023, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_2>>name>>Suzan Verberne": 0.1311553716659546, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_7>>authors>>authors_4>>Hsiang-Fu Yu": 0.1350904107093811, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>affiliation>>Australian National University": 0.13745635747909546, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>affiliation>>Microsoft Research Montreal, Canada": 0.13793182373046875, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>affiliation>>Max Plank Institute for Software Systems, Germany": 0.13801801204681396, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Topics>>Topics_1>>Web query and document analysis, representation and understanding": 0.13814973831176758, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>personal homepage>>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/": 0.14009219408035278, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>name>>Alexandra Olteanu": 0.1401386857032776, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_7>>authors>>authors_3>>Jyun-Yu Jiang": 0.1412128210067749, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>personal homepage>>https://deboradonato.com/": 0.1419338583946228, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Semantics and Knowledge Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>name>>Miriam Fernandez": 0.14208418130874634, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_157>>authors>>authors_5>>Mike Bendersky and Marc Najork": 0.14272892475128174}, "What is the contact information for the Search Track of The Web Conference (WWW2023)?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Contact>>search-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.0867277979850769, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>SPONSOR CHAIRS>>contact>>sponsorship2023@thewebconf.org": 0.10205847024917603, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Contact>>websoc-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.10383152961730957, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things Track>>Contact>>sys-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.10668677091598511, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>In case you have doubts whether your paper fits the scope of this track, please contact the track chairs>>search-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.10831707715988159, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Contact>>webmining-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.1089063286781311, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Conference>>The Web Conference": 0.11063766479492188, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Workshops Proposals>>Contact>>www2023-workshops@easychair.org": 0.11109292507171631, "WWW2023>>calls>>Special Track>>CFP: History of the Web>>Contact>>history2023@thewebconf.org": 0.11157667636871338, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTEERS>>Contact>>volunteer2023@thewebconf.org": 0.11198616027832031, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>SPECIAL TRACK: HISTORY OF THE WEB>>contact>>history2023@thewebconf.org": 0.1120179295539856, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>conference_details>>conference_website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.11206710338592529, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Semantics and Knowledge Track>>Contact>>sk-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.11307835578918457, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.11378079652786255}, "What is the location and date of The Web Conference (WWW2023)?": {"WWW2023>>About>>The Web Conference>>The Web Conference_1>>The Web Conference (formerly WWW conference) is a yearly international conference on the topic of the future directions of the World Wide Web.": 0.10611951351165771, "WWW2023>>About>>The Web Conference>>The Web Conference_3>>The World Wide Web was first conceived in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.

However, black-box approaches have raised fundamental concerns for ethics, accountability, explainability, and musical plausibility. To enable trustworthy machine creativity, we introduce the Harmonic Memory, a Knowledge Graph (KG) of harmonic patterns extracted from a large and heterogeneous musical corpus. By leveraging a cognitive model of tonal harmony, chord progressions are segmented into meaningful structures, and patterns emerge from their comparison via harmonic similarity. Akin to a music memory, the KG holds temporal connections between consecutive patterns, as well as salient similarity relationships. After demonstrating the validity of our choices, we provide examples of how this design enables novel pathways for combinational creativity. The memory provides a fully accountable and explainable framework to inspire and support creative professionals – allowing for the discovery of progressions consistent with given criteria, the recomposition of harmonic sections, but also the co-creation of new progressions.": 0.2141110897064209}, "What technologies does the 'Reflex-in' installation incorporate?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Special Track: The Creative Web>>SESSION: Special Track: The Creative Web_1>>abstract>>Reflex-in is a sound installation that uses brain-wave streams to create music composition within the Web environment in real time.

However, traditional ABR algorithms perform poorly on IPFS because the throughput cannot be estimated correctly. The main problem is that video segments can be retrieved from multiple sources, making it difficult to estimate the throughput. To overcome this issue, we have designed Telescope, an IPFS-aware ABR system. We conduct experiments on the IPFS network, where IPFS video providers are geographically distributed across the globe. Our results show that Telescope significantly improves the Quality of Experience (QoE) of videos, for a diverse set of network and cache conditions, compared to traditional ABR.": 0.23655176162719727, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things Track>>submission_rejection_policy>>Submissions that are out of scope or unresponsive to the call above will be rejected early during the reviewing process (“desk rejected”) with minimal feedback.": 0.24005812406539917}, "What is the purpose of Industry Track at The Web Conference 2023 (WWW2023)?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Industry Proposals>>description>>We invite contributions to the Industry Track to be held at The Web Conference 2023 (formerly known as WWW).

Collaborative inference is a promising approach to supporting DL models, by which the data owner (the victim) runs the first layers of the model on her local device and then a cloud provider (the adversary) runs the remaining layers of the model. Compared to offloading the entire model to the cloud, the collaborative inference approach is more data privacy-preserving as the owner’s model input is not exposed to outsiders. However, we show in this paper that the adversary can restore the victim’s model input by exploiting the output of the victim’s local model. Our attack is dubbed Ginver 1: Generative model inversion attacks against collaborative inference. Once trained, Ginver can infer the victim’s unseen model inputs without remaking the inversion attack model and thus has the generative capability. We extensively evaluate Ginver under different settings (e.g., white-box and black-box of the victim’s local model) and applications (e.g., CIFAR10 and FaceScrub datasets).

The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.": 0.11990547180175781, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_29>>title>>Bad Apples: Understanding the Centralized Security Risks in Decentralized Ecosystems": 0.15083402395248413, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_17>>title>>All Your Shops Are Belong to Us: Security Weaknesses in E-commerce Platforms": 0.18250000476837158}, "In the BERT4ETH: A Pre-trained Transformer for Ethereum Fraud Detection study, what were some of the serious vulnerabilities found?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_26>>abstract>>As various forms of fraud proliferate on Ethereum, it is imperative to safeguard against these malicious activities to protect susceptible users from being victimized. While current studies solely rely on graph-based fraud detection approaches, it is argued that they may not be well-suited for dealing with highly repetitive, skew-distributed and heterogeneous Ethereum transactions. To address these challenges, we propose BERT4ETH, a universal pre-trained Transformer encoder that serves as an account representation extractor for detecting various fraud behaviors on Ethereum. BERT4ETH features the superior modeling capability of Transformer to capture the dynamic sequential patterns inherent in Ethereum transactions, and addresses the challenges of pre-training a BERT model for Ethereum with three practical and effective strategies, namely repetitiveness reduction, skew alleviation and heterogeneity modeling.

However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations. We demonstrate our automated approach on several large ontologies from the oceanographic domain and show its agreement with a manual evaluation by domain experts and its superiority over the state-of-the-art.": 0.13383567333221436, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_13>>title>>TaxoComplete: Self-Supervised Taxonomy Completion Leveraging Position-Enhanced Semantic Matching": 0.17071431875228882}, "Which paper talks about the conversion of Legal Agreements into Smart Legal Contracts using NLP?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_1>>abstract>>A Smart Legal Contract (SLC) is a specialized digital agreement comprising natural language and computable components.

This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project’s Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text.

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

Last year the workshop was held virtually in Lyon, France. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications’ role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing.

The smart city hub (SCHub) introduces a new concept that aims to homogenize data, service, human and material flows in cities. A proof of concept is based on non-typical data flows, like the ones that are collected by biotechnological activities, like Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally. Most of the diet related NCDs are related to the gut microbiome, the microbial community that resides in our gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance or loss of microbiome diversity is one of the main factors leading to NCDs by affecting various functions, including energy metabolism, intestinal permeability, and brain function. Gut dysbiosis is reflected in altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by the gut microbiota. A microcapsule system can play the role of a sensor that collects data from the local community and transmits it to the SCHub in order for the doctors to receive the appropriate patients information and define the appropriate treatment method; for the city to process anonymized information and measure community's health in diet terms. A prototype with a biosensor that correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacities is presented in this paper, together with the use-case scenario that engages the SCHub.": 0.15453588962554932}, "What is the unique feature of the web-based application presented in the paper titled 'Towards a Sustainability Index Calculator for Smart Cities'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 9th WebAndTheCity -The Web and Smart Cities>>SESSION: Workshop: 9th WebAndTheCity -The Web and Smart Cities_4>>abstract>>In this era of rapid urbanization and our endeavors to create more smart cities, it's crucial to keep track of how our society and neighborhood are getting impacted. It is important to make conscious decisions to keep harmony in sustainability. There are multiple frameworks to evaluate how sustainability is measured and to understand how sustainable a place is, be it a city or a region, and one such framework is the Circles of Sustainability. Though these frameworks offer good solutions, it is a challenge to collect relevant data to make the framework widely usable. This paper focuses on this specific issue by utilizing the methodology introduced in the framework and applying it practically to better understand how sustainable our cities and society are. We present a unique web-based application which utilizes publicly accessible data to compute sustainability scores and rank for every city and presents the results in an intelligent and easy to comprehend visual interface.

However, the complexity of fairness definitions and the proliferation of fairness metrics in research literature have led to a complex decision-making space. This environment makes it challenging for practitioners to operationalize and pick metrics that work within their unique context. This suggests that practitioners require more decision-making support, but it is not clear what type of support would be beneficial. We conducted a literature review of 24 papers to gather metrics introduced by the research community for measuring fairness in recommendation and ranking systems. We organized these metrics into a ‘decision-tree style’ support framework designed to help practitioners scope fairness objectives and identify fairness metrics relevant to their recommendation domain and application context. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using this framework to assess which challenges practitioners may face when scoping fairness objectives and metrics for their system, and which further support may be needed beyond such tools.": 0.13198566436767578}, "What is the main issue addressed in the paper 'Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_11>>abstract>>Pairwise learning strategies are prevalent for optimizing recommendation models on implicit feedback data, which usually learns user preference by discriminating between positive (i.e., clicked by a user) and negative items (i.e., obtained by negative sampling). However, the size of different item groups (specified by item attribute) is usually unevenly distributed. We empirically find that the commonly used uniform negative sampling strategy for pairwise algorithms (e.g., BPR) can inherit such data bias and oversample the majority item group as negative instances, severely countering group fairness on the item side. In this paper, we propose a Fairly adaptive Negative sampling approach (FairNeg), which improves item group fairness via adaptively adjusting the group-level negative sampling distribution in the training process. In particular, it first perceives the model’s unfairness status at each step and then adjusts the group-wise sampling distribution with an adaptive momentum update strategy for better facilitating fairness optimization. Moreover, a negative sampling distribution Mixup mechanism is proposed, which gracefully incorporates existing importance-aware sampling techniques intended for mining informative negative samples, thus allowing for achieving multiple optimization purposes.

However, it is unclear to what extent LMs “reuse” a training corpus. For instance, models can generate paraphrased sentences that are contextually similar to training samples. In this work, therefore, we study three types of plagiarism (i.e., verbatim, paraphrase, and idea) among GPT-2 generated texts, in comparison to its training data, and further analyze the plagiarism patterns of fine-tuned LMs with domain-specific corpora which are extensively used in practice. Our results suggest that (1) three types of plagiarism widely exist in LMs beyond memorization, (2) both size and decoding methods of LMs are strongly associated with the degrees of plagiarism they exhibit, and (3) fine-tuned LMs’ plagiarism patterns vary based on their corpus similarity and homogeneity. Given that a majority of LMs’ training data is scraped from the Web without informing content owners, their reiteration of words, phrases, and even core ideas from training sets into generated texts has ethical implications. Their patterns are likely to exacerbate as both the size of LMs and their training data increase, raising concerns about indiscriminately pursuing larger models with larger training corpora. Plagiarized content can also contain individuals’ personal and sensitive information. These findings overall cast doubt on the practicality of current LMs in mission-critical writing tasks and urge more discussions around the observed phenomena.

Finally, a novel reinforcement learning-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm is proposed to verify the performance of BiSR on real network traces. Our evaluation, using a full system implementation, shows that BiSR saves 26% of bitrate compared to the traditional H.264 codec and improves the SSIM of video by 3.7% compared to the prior state-of-the-art.

Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system. Typing errors make the problem even more challenging. Streaming services uses spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features to address this issue up to certain extent.

This problem is aggravated when there is no behavioral data available for new content. Poor quality recommendation for these items lead to user dissatisfaction and short content shelf-life. In this paper we propose a solution MEMER (Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations), that utilises the multimodal semantic information of content and uses it to generate better quality embeddings for early-stage items. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by extending it to various explicit and implicit user actions. Using these learnt embeddings, we conduct offline and online experiments to verify its effectiveness. The predicted embeddings show significant gains in online early-stage experiments for both videos and images (videos:  44% relative gain in click through rate,  46% relative gain in explicit engagements,  9% relative gain in successful video play,  20% relative reduction in skips, images:  56% relative gain in explicit engagements).

ELTE first extracts key-phrases from episode title and description metadata. It then uses entity linking to canonicalize them against Wikipedia knowledge base (KB), ensuring that the topics exist in the real world. ELTE also models NIL-predictions for entity or event topics that are not in the KB, as well as topics that are not of entity or event type. To test the model, we construct a podcast topic database of 1166 episodes from various categories. Each episode comes with a Wiki-link annotated main topic or NIL-prediction.

Query'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_11>>abstract>>Knowledge graph question answering aims to identify answers of the query according to the facts in the knowledge graph. In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries.

We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance.

A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding. The performance of these detection algorithms can be taken as a baseline for future research on detecting malicious bidding.": 0.1150464415550232, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_360>>title>>A Dataset on Malicious Paper Bidding in Peer Review": 0.11902111768722534, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_329>>title>>Learning to Bid in Contextual First Price Auctions": 0.15372580289840698, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_2>>title>>Autobidding Auctions in the Presence of User Costs": 0.16517996788024902}, "What is the main finding of the paper 'Hidden Indicators of Collective Intelligence in Crowdfunding'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>abstract>>Extensive literature argues that crowds possess essential collective intelligence benefits that allow superior decision-making by untrained individuals working in low-information environments. Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign. Our findings broaden the field of crowd-aware system design and inform discussions about the augmentation of traditional financing systems with tech innovations.": 0.11275249719619751, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>title>>Hidden Indicators of Collective Intelligence in Crowdfunding": 0.16217613220214844}, "Who are the track chairs for the 'Web and Society Track' at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>name>>Juhi Kulshrestha": 0.08787894248962402, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>affiliation>>Australian National University": 0.08917492628097534, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>personal homepage>>https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cdm/people/faculty/juhi-kulshrestha/": 0.09466439485549927, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>personal homepage>>http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/": 0.09695065021514893, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>affiliation>>Ancestry, USA": 0.09952479600906372, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>affiliation>>Max Plank Institute for Software Systems, Germany": 0.10076195001602173, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>affiliation>>Microsoft Research Montreal, Canada": 0.10388827323913574, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>personal homepage>>http://ujwalgadiraju.com/": 0.10482591390609741, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Contact>>websoc-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.10534054040908813, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>affiliation>>University of Konstanz": 0.10560017824172974, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Security, Privacy & Trust Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>name>>Pierangela Samarati": 0.1057007908821106, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>personal homepage>>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/": 0.10579651594161987, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>affiliation>>Microsoft Research": 0.10692226886749268}, "What is the primary focus of the 'Web and Society Track' at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Description>>The Web deeply impacts and co-evolves with societies worldwide.

Aggregating heterogeneous healthcare data becomes doable which is essential for evidence-based care.

In this paper, we propose a multi-step process to achieve the same. First, we explore the semantic sentence segmentation of SEBI case files via classification. We also propose a dataset of Indian legal adjudicating orders which contain tags from carefully crafted domain-specific sentence categories with the help of legal experts. We experiment with various machine learning and deep learning methods for this multi-class classification.

A general framework is to extract supporting evidence from the table and text and then perform numerical reasoning over extracted evidence for inferring the answer. However, existing models are vulnerable to missing supporting evidence, which limits their performance. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic-Oriented Hierarchical Graph (SoarGraph) that models the semantic relationships and dependencies among the different elements (e.g., question, table cells, text paragraphs, quantities, and dates) using hierarchical graphs to facilitate supporting evidence extraction and enhance numerical reasoning capability.

We propose an anomaly detection approach based on network analysis to help AFC officers navigating through the high load of information that is typical of AFC data-driven scenarios. By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network metrics that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the metric-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system.

products, including circulating materials or product parts before they become waste. Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains. This will enable us to in the future explore what existing knowledge can be adapted or used to develop ontologies for circular value networks.": 0.11487060785293579}, "What is the name of the Knowledge Graph being built to store relevant data about Environmental Assessment reporting and practice in Denmark?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability - KG4S>>SESSION: Workshop: The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability - KG4S_1>>abstract>>An environmental assessment (EA) report describes and assesses the environmental impact of a series of activities involved in the development of a project.

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.": 0.14792335033416748, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_39>>abstract>>We present Templet: an online question answering (QA) system for Wikidata.

Existing works assumed that member and non-member users follow different recommendation modes, and then infer membership based on the difference vector between the user’s historical behaviors and the recommendation list. The previous frameworks are invalid against inductive recommendations, such as sequential recommendations, since the disparities of difference vectors constructed by the recommendations between members and non-members become imperceptible.

However, most existing visualization recommendation systems focus on ranking all possible visualizations based on the attributes or encodings, which makes it difficult to find the most relevant insights. We therefore introduce a novel class of insight-based visualization recommendation systems that automatically rank and recommend groups of related insights as well as the most important insights within each group. Our approach combines results from different learning-based methods to discover insights automatically and generalizes to a variety of attribute types (e.g., categorical, numerical, and temporal), including non-trivial combinations of these attribute types. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we implemented a insight-centric visualization recommendation system, SpotLight, and conducted a user study with twelve participants, which showed that users are able to quickly find and understand relevant insights in unfamiliar data.": 0.18254995346069336}, "What is the Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering that the project 'C-Affinity: A Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering' propose?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_10>>title>>C-Affinity: A Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering": 0.1127476692199707, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_10>>abstract>>Clustering is widely employed in various applications as it is one of the most useful data mining techniques. In performing clustering, a similarity measure, which defines how similar a pair of data objects are, plays an important role. A similarity measure is employed by considering a target dataset’s characteristics. Current similarity measures (or distances) do not reflect the distribution of data objects in a dataset at all. From the clustering point of view, this fact may limit the clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose c-affinity, a new notion of a similarity measure that reflects the distribution of objects in the given dataset from a clustering point of view. We design c-affinity between any two objects to have a higher value as they are more likely to belong to the same cluster by learning the data distribution. We use random walk with restart (RWR) on the k-nearest neighbor graph of the given dataset to measure (1) how similar a pair of objects are and (2) how densely other objects are distributed between them. Via extensive experiments on sixteen synthetic and real-world datasets, we verify that replacing the existing similarity measure with our c-affinity improves the clustering accuracy significantly.": 0.1374882459640503}, "What approach does the project 'Measuring Potential Performance Gains of Python Web Applications with pyUpgradeSim' use to measure the performance of OSS projects?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_54>>title>>Measuring Potential Performance Gains of Python Web Applications with pyUpgradeSim": 0.14842969179153442, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_42>>abstract>>Python is a popular programming language for web development.

We discover that the two methods behave very differently depending on the sparsity of the data set, where sparsity is defined by the amount of historical viewing data available to explain a movie recommendation for a particular data instance. We find that LIME does better than SHAP in dense segments of the data set and SHAP does better in sparse segments. We trace this difference to the differing bias-variance characteristics of the underlying estimators of LIME and SHAP. We find that SHAP exhibits lower variance in sparse segments of the data compared to LIME. We attribute this lower variance to the completeness constraint property inherent in SHAP and missing in LIME. This constraint acts as a regularizer and therefore increases the bias of the SHAP estimator but decreases its variance, leading to a favorable bias-variance trade-off especially in high sparsity data settings. With this insight, we introduce the same constraint into LIME and formulate a novel local explainabilty framework called Completeness-Constrained LIME (CLIME) that is superior to LIME and much faster

Topic modeling is a widely used technique for analyzing short text documents and uncovering the underlying topics. However, traditional topic models face difficulties in accurately extracting topics from short texts due to limited content and their sparse nature.

Existing work on Wikipedia text generation has focused on English only where English reference articles are summarized to generate English Wikipedia pages. But, for low-resource languages, the scarcity of reference articles makes monolingual summarization ineffective in solving this problem. Hence, in this work, we propose XWikiGen, which is the task of cross-lingual multi-document summarization of text from multiple reference articles, written in various languages, to generate Wikipedia-style text. Accordingly, we contribute a benchmark dataset, XWikiRef, spanning ∼ 69K Wikipedia articles covering five domains and eight languages. We harness this dataset to train a two-stage system where the input is a set of citations and a section title and the output is a section-specific LR summary. The proposed system is based on a novel idea of neural unsupervised extractive summarization to coarsely identify salient information followed by a neural abstractive model to generate the section-specific text.

However, these methods do not capture local wealth fluctuations, and are not optimized to produce accountable results that guarantee accurate predictions to all sub-populations. Here, we propose a pipeline of machine learning models to infer the mean and standard deviation of wealth across multiple geographically clustered populated places, and illustrate their performance in Sierra Leone and Uganda. These models leverage seven independent and freely available feature sources based on satellite images, and metadata collected via online crowd-sourcing and social media. Our models show that combined metadata features are the best predictors of wealth in rural areas, outperforming image-based models, which are the best for predicting the highest wealth quintiles. Our results recover the local mean and variation of wealth, and correctly capture the positive yet non-monotonous correlation between them. We further demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of model transfer across countries and the effects of data recency and other biases.

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines.

In this paper, we study a critical type of online misinformation, namely fauxtography, where the image and associated text of a social media post jointly convey a questionable or false sense. In particular, we focus on a sparse semi-supervised fauxtography detection problem, which aims to accurately identify fauxtography by only using the sparsely annotated ground truth labels of social media posts. Our problem is motivated by the key limitation of current fauxtography detection approaches that often require a large amount of expensive and inefficient manual annotations to train an effective fauxtography detection model. We identify two key technical challenges in solving the problem: 1) it is non-trivial to train an accurate detection model given the sparse fauxtography annotations, and 2) it is difficult to extract the heterogeneous and complicated fauxtography features from the multi-modal social media posts for accurate fauxtography detection. To address the above challenges, we propose ContrastFaux, a multi-view contrastive learning framework that jointly explores the sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multi-modal posts to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. Evaluation results on two social media datasets demonstrate that ContrastFaux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning fauxtography detection baselines by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy.": 0.118011474609375}, "What dataset was used in the paper 'EDNet: Attention-Based Multimodal Representation for Classification of Twitter Users Related to Eating Disorders'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_16>>abstract>>Social media platforms provide rich data sources in several domains. In mental health, individuals experiencing an Eating Disorder (ED) are often hesitant to seek help through conventional healthcare services. However, many people seek help with diet and body image issues on social media. To better distinguish at-risk users who may need help for an ED from those who are simply commenting on ED in social environments, highly sophisticated approaches are required. Assessment of ED risks in such a situation can be done in various ways, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hence, there is a need for and potential benefit of a more complex multimodal approach. To this end, we collect historical tweets, user biographies, and online behaviours of relevant users from Twitter, and generate a reasonably large labelled benchmark dataset. Thereafter, we develop an advanced multimodal deep learning model called EDNet using these data to identify the different types of users with ED engagement (e.g., potential ED sufferers, healthcare professionals, or communicators) and distinguish them from those not experiencing EDs on Twitter. EDNet consists of five deep neural network layers. With the help of its embedding, representation and behaviour modeling layers, it effectively learns the multimodalities of social media. In our experiments, EDNet consistently outperforms all the baseline techniques by significant margins. It achieves an accuracy of up to 94.32% and F1 score of up to 93.91% F1 score.

Most research focuses on high-resource languages. However, malicious actors share content across countries and languages, including low-resource ones. Here, we investigate whether and to what extent malicious actors can be detected in low-resource language settings. We discovered that a high number of accounts posting in Tagalog were suspended as part of Twitter’s crackdown on interference operations after the 2016 US Presidential election. By combining text embedding and transfer learning, our framework can detect, with promising accuracy, malicious users posting in Tagalog without any prior knowledge or training on malicious content in that language. We first learn an embedding model for each language, namely a high-resource language (English) and a low-resource one (Tagalog), independently. Then, we learn a mapping between the two latent spaces to transfer the detection model.

Finding groups of nodes that form strongly stable agreements and participate in collective conflicts with other groups is an important problem in this context. Previous works approach this problem by finding balanced subgraphs, in which the polarity measure is optimized, that result in large subgraphs without a clear notion of agreement or conflict. In real-world signed networks, balanced subgraphs are often not polarized as in the case of a subgraph with only positive edges. To remedy this issue, we leverage the notion of cohesion — we find pairs of cohesively polarized communities where each node in a community is positively connected to nodes in the same community and negatively connected to nodes in the other community. To capture the cohesion along with the polarization, we define a new measure, dichotomy. We leverage the balanced triangles, which model the cohesion and polarization at the same time, to design a heuristic that results in good seedbeds for polarized communities in real-world signed networks. Then, we introduce the electron decomposition which finds cohesively polarized communities with high dichotomy score. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method finds cohesively polarized communities and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to several measures.

critical tasks including node classification and link prediction. However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

To preserve the heterogeneous semantics on HINs, the rich node/edge types become a cornerstone of HIN representation learning. However, in real-world scenarios, type information is often noisy, missing or inaccessible. Assuming no type information is given, we define a so-called latent heterogeneous graph (LHG), which carries latent heterogeneous semantics as the node/edge types cannot be observed. In this paper, we study the challenging and unexplored problem of link prediction on an LHG. As existing approaches depend heavily on type-based information, they are suboptimal or even inapplicable on LHGs. To address the absence of type information, we propose a model named LHGNN, based on the novel idea of semantic embedding at node and path levels, to capture latent semantics on and between nodes. We further design a personalization function to modulate the heterogeneous contexts conditioned on their latent semantics w.r.t. the target node, to enable finer-grained aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of LHGNN.": 0.1457369327545166, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_25>>title>>Link Prediction on Latent Heterogeneous Graphs": 0.1516132354736328, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)_16>>title>>PaGE-Link: Path-based Graph Neural Network Explanation for Heterogeneous Link Prediction": 0.15433549880981445, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_48>>title>>Homophily-oriented Heterogeneous Graph Rewiring": 0.15486836433410645, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_59>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583529": 0.15629547834396362}, "What is the title of the paper authored by Aisling Third and John Domingue?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_29>>authors>>authors_3>>Xinping Yi and Rui Zhang": 0.1504102349281311, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_320>>authors>>authors_2>>Jiqun Liu and Tetsuya Sakai": 0.16133499145507812, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_6>>authors>>authors_4>>Tong Liu and Lingling Lu": 0.16150009632110596, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_218>>title>>Quantifying and Defending against Privacy Threats on Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding": 0.1629212498664856, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_137>>title>>Descartes: Generating Short Descriptions of Wikipedia Articles": 0.16424304246902466, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_12>>authors>>authors_3>>Mingming Li": 0.16526436805725098, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_125>>authors>>authors_2>>Yunsheng Bai": 0.16609406471252441, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_279>>authors>>authors_5>>Mingtao Zhang and Xiang Jing": 0.1661171317100525, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_245>>authors>>authors_4>>Saeid Hosseini and Xiaofang Zhou": 0.1666187047958374, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_169>>authors>>authors_3>>Yinglong Ma": 0.16695505380630493, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_261>>authors>>authors_3>>Evangelos P.

The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers.

It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID).

This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of the metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above problems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving features designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for metaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to participate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational power, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only protects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high computing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many studies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some of the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with unlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse and FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse technologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the Internet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality. Finally, we discuss some key challenges and promising directions of FL4M in detail. In summary, we hope that our up-to-date brief survey can help people better understand FL4M and build a fair, open, and secure metaverse.": 0.1165195107460022, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_2>>title>>Federated Learning for Metaverse: A Survey": 0.1298762559890747}, "What are some of the concerns surrounding AI-based systems that the 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies is addressing?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_4>>title>>A Survey of Trustworthy Federated Learning with Perspectives on Security, Robustness and Privacy": 0.11911678314208984, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_4>>abstract>>The goal of this workshop is to focus the attention of the TheWebConf research community on addressing the open questions and challenges in this thriving research area.

However, the lack of affordability of mobile broadband services in many developing countries and the rising complexity of websites create barriers for citizens in accessing these government websites. This paper presents the first large-scale analysis of the affordability of public service websites in developing countries. We do this by collecting a corpus of 1900 public service websites, including public websites from nine developing countries and for comparison websites from nine developed countries. Our investigation is driven by website complexity analysis as well as evaluation through a recently proposed affordability index. Our analysis reveals that, in general, public service websites in developing countries do not meet the affordability target set by the UN’s Broadband Commission. However, we show that several countries can be brought within or closer to the affordability target by implementing webpage optimizations to reduce page sizes.

This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text. Our experimental results on the TLS-Covid19 test collection demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.": 0.1172603964805603}, "What impact of COVID-19 does the paper authored by Ke Li, Zhiwen Yu, Ying Zhang, and Bin Guo analyze?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_29>>authors>>authors_3>>Xinping Yi and Rui Zhang": 0.16895192861557007, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_12>>authors>>authors_3>>Mingming Li": 0.18222635984420776, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_320>>authors>>authors_2>>Jiqun Liu and Tetsuya Sakai": 0.18344980478286743, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_90>>authors>>authors_5>>Huifeng Guo": 0.1839514970779419, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_125>>authors>>authors_2>>Yunsheng Bai": 0.18407076597213745, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_3>>authors>>authors_4>>Xiwei Zhao": 0.18473178148269653, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_277>>authors>>authors_6>>Shenglin Zhang": 0.184853196144104, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_109>>authors>>authors_2>>Zhankui He": 0.18500077724456787, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_90>>authors>>authors_1>>Wei Guo": 0.1852533221244812, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_136>>authors>>authors_2>>Qi Liu": 0.18535691499710083, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_16>>authors>>authors_4>>Liang Wang and Bo Zheng": 0.1854373812675476, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_132>>authors>>authors_3>>Yongchun Zhu": 0.18561416864395142, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_192>>authors>>authors_5>>Lifeng Gao": 0.18600088357925415, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_340>>authors>>authors_1>>Yongkang Guo": 0.18640679121017456, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_5>>authors>>authors_6>>Guanzhou Han and Yanghua Xiao": 0.1868525743484497}, "What is the title of the paper by the authors Simona Corciulo, Livio Bioglio, Valerio Basile, Viviana Patti and Rossana Damiano in 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587631": 0.09289741516113281, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_1>>abstract>>In this paper, we describe our intuitions about how language technologies can contribute to create new ways to enhance the accessibility of exhibits in cultural contexts by exploiting the knowledge about the history of our senses and the link between perception and language.": 0.09407150745391846, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>title>>The DEEP Sensorium: a multidimensional approach to sensory domain labelling": 0.09639221429824829, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>abstract>>We evaluate the performance of five multi-class classification models for the task of sensory recognition and introduce the DEEP Sensorium (Deep Engaging Experiences and Practices -

It can be used for similar products retrieval from different suppliers or duplicate products detection of one supplier. Common methods use the image as the detected object, but they only consider the visual features and overlook the attribute information contained in the textual descriptions, and perform weakly for products in image less important industries like machinery, hardware tools and electronic component, even if an additional text matching module is added. In this paper, we propose a unified vision-language modeling method for e-commerce same-style products retrieval, which is designed to represent one product with its textual descriptions and visual contents. It contains one sampling skill to collect positive pairs from user click logs with category and relevance constrained, and a novel contrastive loss unit to model the image, text, and image+text representations into one joint embedding space. It is capable of cross-modal product-to-product retrieval, as well as style transfer and user-interactive search. Offline evaluations on annotated data demonstrate its superior retrieval performance, and online testings show it can attract more clicks and conversions.

The Metaverse – the emerging ecosphere built upon web and internet platforms has become an integral part of the today’s digital society. Representing a new paradigm, the Metaverse is made up of virtual worlds developed in extended reality (XR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR) and augmentative reality (AR) technologies. The Metaverse has opened up a plethora of exciting opportunities in which accessibility and inclusive design are important attributes. As tech writer Julie Brehuescu recently wrote for The Drum, “One goal of the metaverse is to replicate the feeling of real-world connection by creating immersive virtual environments. But it may also make the internet more accessible to the more than one billion people who struggle to interact with digital content each day due to neurodivergence, disability or other impairments.” How can the Metaverse adapt to working and learning environments to ensure user needs are met quickly and efficiently? What solutions exist to encourage the autonomy and well-being of people with disabilities and older adults? What are the social, financial, cultural or ethical implications of deploying immersive web solutions without accessibility in mind?

We show that there exist sublinear query and time algorithms for testing three key properties of signed graphs: balance (or 2-clusterability), clusterability and signed triangle freeness. We consider both the dense graph model, where one queries the adjacency matrix entries of a signed graph, and the bounded-degree model, where one queries for the neighbors of a node and the sign of the connecting edge. Our algorithms use a variety of tools from unsigned graph property testing, as well as reductions from one setting to the other. Our main technical contribution is a sublinear algorithm for testing clusterability in the bounded-degree model.

Most of the existing methods essentially optimize a Frobenius-like distance or ranking-based loss, ignoring the underlying geometry of graph data. Optimal transport (OT), together with Wasserstein distance, has emerged to be a powerful approach accounting for the underlying geometry explicitly. Promising as it might be, the state-of-the-art OT-based alignment methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) effectiveness due to the insufficient use of topology and consistency information and (2) scalability due to the non-convex formulation and repeated computationally costly loss calculation. In this paper, we propose a position-aware regularized optimal transport framework for network alignment named PARROT. To tackle the effectiveness issue, the proposed PARROT captures topology information by random walk with restart, with three carefully designed consistency regularization terms. To tackle the scalability issue, the regularized OT problem is decomposed into a series of convex subproblems and can be efficiently solved by the proposed constrained proximal point method with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves significant improvements in both effectiveness and scalability, outperforming the state-of-the-art network alignment methods and speeding up existing OT-based methods by up to 100 times.": 0.11846202611923218, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION:

In this short paper, we present the “Solid Data Space” (SDS), a concept for dataspaces that build on top of the (Semantic) Web and Social Linked Data (Solid). Existing Web technologies and Linked Data principles form the foundation for open, decentralized networks for sovereign data exchange between citizens, organizations and companies. Domain-specific dataspace implementations can extend the agreements for communication and collaboration to enable specific functionality.

The use of data spaces, where data is exchanged among members in a self-regulated environment, is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current manual practices of managing metadata and vocabularies in these spaces are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the needs of all stakeholders. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we believe that semantic interoperability in data spaces can be significantly improved. This involves automatically generating and updating metadata, which results in a more flexible vocabulary that can accommodate the diverse terminologies used by different sub-communities. Our vision for the future of data spaces addresses the limitations of conventional data exchange and makes data more accessible and valuable for all members of the community.": 0.11326271295547485}, "What is the goal of the PLASMA Framework as per 'The PLASMA Framework: Laying the Path to Domain-Specific Semantics in Dataspaces' paper?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: First workshop on Semantics in Dataspaces (SDS 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: First workshop on Semantics in Dataspaces (SDS 2023)_7>>abstract>>Modern data management is evolving from centralized integration-based solutions to a non-integration-based process of finding, accessing and processing data, as observed within dataspaces. Common reference dataspace architectures assume that sources publish their own domain-specific schema.

Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine.

present their collections to the public. However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations. Through multimodal interaction, we aim to encourage innovation on the Web and create more visually appealing and engaging virtual displays.

Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods. We conclude with the transferability and robustness of our approach to identify creative harmful memes.": 0.08853644132614136, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_1>>title>>Identifying Creative Harmful Memes via Prompt based Approach": 0.1202436089515686, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3587427": 0.1381063461303711, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_22>>title>>Chain of Explanation: New Prompting Method to Generate Quality Natural Language Explanation for Implicit Hate Speech": 0.13890743255615234}, "Who are the authors of the research named 'SA-Fusion: Multimodal Fusion Approach for Web-based Human-Computer Interaction in the Wild' at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_6>>authors>>authors_2>>Jianghong Ma": 0.129228413105011, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_164>>authors>>authors_5>>Kai Zhang and X.

However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models.

However, the interaction signal may not be sufficient to accurately characterize user interests and the low-pass filters may ignore the useful information contained in the high-frequency component of the observed signals, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To this end, we propose a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design the personalized graph signal containing richer user information and construct an augmented similarity graph containing more graph topology information, to more effectively characterize user interests. Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful information in the high-frequency components of the observed signals by combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the personalized graph signal, the augmented similarity graph and the mixed-frequency graph filter by proposing a pipeline consisting of three key steps: pre-processing, graph convolution and post-processing. Extensive experiments show that PGSP can achieve superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art CF methods and, as a nonparametric method, PGSP has very high training efficiency.": 0.10587418079376221, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_48>>title>>Personalized Graph Signal Processing for Collaborative Filtering": 0.13550496101379395}, "What is the proposed solution by the authors of the paper 'Confident Action Decision via Hierarchical Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation' in regards to reading large tables on small mobile screens?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_60>>abstract>>Reading large tables on small mobile screens presents serious usability challenges that can be addressed, in part, by better table formatting.

By normalizing user/item embeddings to a specific value, we empirically observe impressive performance gains (9% on average) on four real-world datasets.

This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work.

However, the use of such algorithms comes with trade-offs in terms of algorithmic fairness, which has been widely acknowledged. Specifically, we have empirically observed that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn, causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive users. To address the above issues, we propose DP-Fair, a two-stage framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations. The experimental results, based on Amazon datasets, and user history logs collected from Etsy, one of the largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of both overall accuracy and user group fairness on both shallow and deep recommendation models compared to vanilla DP-SGD.": 0.11534076929092407, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_16>>abstract>>Algorithmic fairness has become an important machine learning problem, especially for mission-critical Web applications.

Our model uses contrastive loss to generate embeddings that are indistinguishable for each protected group, while forcing the embeddings of counterfactual pairs to be similar. It then uses a self-knowledge distillation method to maintain the quality of representation for the downstream tasks.

An eligible continual few-shot learning model is expected to distinguish all seen classes upon new categories arriving, where each category only includes very few labeled data. However, existing continual few-shot learning methods only consider the visual modality, where the distributions of new categories often indistinguishably overlap with old categories, thus resulting in the severe catastrophic forgetting problem. To tackle this problem, in this paper we study continual few-shot learning with the assistance of semantic knowledge by simultaneously taking both visual modality and semantic concepts of categories into account. We propose a Continual few-shot learning algorithm with Semantic knowledge Regularization (CoSR) for adapting to the distribution changes of visual prototypes through a Transformer-based prototype adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the original visual prototypes from the backbone are fed into the well-designed Transformer with corresponding semantic concepts, where the semantic concepts are extracted from all categories. The semantic-level regularization forces the categories with similar semantics to be closely distributed, while the opposite ones are constrained to be far away from each other. The semantic regularization improves the model’s ability to distinguish between new and old categories, thus significantly mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, CUB200 and an industrial dataset with long-tail distribution demonstrate the advantages of our CoSR model compared with state-of-the-art methods.": 0.18089789152145386}, "What challenge does the work 'Active Learning from the Web' by Ryoma Sato aim to address?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_1>>Accessible e-learning, student evaluation and assessment": 0.1569022536277771, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_5>>Enhancements for accessible communication (e.g. accessible information and communication technologies – including social media, learning technologies, authoring technologies, multilingualism)": 0.16003870964050293, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_7>>Social interaction": 0.16348052024841309, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_6>>Online education and remote learning": 0.16626077890396118, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_6>>Assistive technology (3D printing, virtual reality, tactile graphics, etc.)": 0.1725451946258545, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_4>>Telehealth, mental health support and exposure therapy": 0.1729326844215393, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_2>>authors>>authors_6>>Ryosuke Shibasaki": 0.17338597774505615, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_7>>Health and well-being online": 0.17405998706817627, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_3>>Legal issues, including rights and accountability for AI actors": 0.17439061403274536, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Topics include (but are not limited to)>>Web activities and dynamics>>Web activities and dynamics_5>>Models for Web evolution": 0.17532014846801758, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_9>>The Web as a source of news and information": 0.17532235383987427}, "What is the goal of the work 'Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal representation learning for NFT selling price prediction' by Davide Costa, Lucio La Cava, and Andrea Tagarelli?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_46>>title>>Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal representation learning for NFT selling price prediction": 0.1480160355567932, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_52>>abstract>>In this work, we address the above problem based on the hypothesis that NFT images and their textual descriptions are essential proxies to predict the NFT selling prices.

Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image).

For each user request, a few of the microservices are called, and a trace is formed to record the tree-like call dependencies among microservices and the time consumption at each call node. Traces are useful in diagnosing system failures, but their complex structures make it difficult to model their patterns and detect their anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-variable graph variational autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection on microservice traces. To reconstruct the time consumption of nodes, we propose a novel dispatching layer. We find that the inversion of negative log-likelihood (NLL) appears for some anomalous samples, which makes the anomaly score infeasible for anomaly detection. To address this, we point out that the NLL can be decomposed into KL-divergence and data entropy, whereas lower-dimensional anomalies can introduce an entropy gap with normal inputs. We propose three techniques to mitigate this entropy gap for trace anomaly detection: Bernoulli & Categorical Scaling, Node Count Normalization, and Gaussian Std-Limit.

It allows the cloud service provider to sell more resources than the physical limit, assuming not all users would fully utilize the resources simultaneously. However, how to design an oversubscription policy that improves utilization while satisfying some safety constraints remains an open problem. Existing methods and industrial practices are over-conservative, ignoring the coordination of diverse resource usage patterns and probabilistic constraints. To address these two limitations, this paper formulates the oversubscription for cloud as a chance-constrained optimization problem and proposes an effective Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (C2MARL) method to solve this problem. Specifically, C2MARL reduces the number of constraints by considering their upper bounds and leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm to learn a safe and optimal coordination policy.

0.11107802391052246, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_16>>abstract>>Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely used to enhance complex question answering (QA). To understand complex questions, existing studies employ language models (LMs) to encode contexts. Despite the simplicity, they neglect the latent relational information among question concepts and answers in KGs. While question concepts ubiquitously present hyponymy at the semantic level, e.g., mammals and animals, this feature is identically reflected in the hierarchical relations in KGs, e.g., a_type_of. Therefore, we are motivated to explore comprehensive reasoning by the hierarchical structures in KGs to help understand questions. However, it is non-trivial to reason over tree-like structures compared with chained paths. Moreover, identifying appropriate hierarchies relies on expertise. To this end, we propose HamQA, a novel Hierarchy-aware multi-hop Question Answering framework on knowledge graphs, to effectively align the mutual hierarchical information between question contexts and KGs. The entire learning is conducted in Hyperbolic space, inspired by its advantages of embedding hierarchical structures. Specifically, (i) we design a context-aware graph attentive network to capture context information. (ii) Hierarchical structures are continuously preserved in KGs by minimizing the Hyperbolic geodesic distances. The comprehensive reasoning is conducted to jointly train both components and provide a top-ranked candidate as an optimal answer. We achieve a higher ranking than the state-of-the-art multi-hop baselines on the official OpenBookQA leaderboard with an accuracy of 85%.": 0.12034642696380615, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_14>>title>>Hierarchy-Aware Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs": 0.1355007290840149, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_3>>title>>Query-Driven Knowledge Graph Construction using Question Answering and Multimodal Fusion": 0.14334970712661743}, "What is the work of Xinhang Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Jiaxing Xu, Yong Zhang, and Chunxiao Xing focusing on?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_29>>authors>>authors_3>>Xinping Yi and Rui Zhang": 0.15590238571166992, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_31>>authors>>authors_1>>Jincheng Huang": 0.17019081115722656, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_27>>authors>>authors_6>>Li Guo": 0.1728576421737671, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_277>>authors>>authors_6>>Shenglin Zhang": 0.1739950180053711, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_12>>authors>>authors_3>>Mingming Li": 0.1743425726890564, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_35>>authors>>authors_6>>Jianfeng Li": 0.17483758926391602, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_28>>authors>>authors_5>>Zhonghang Li and Siuming Yiu": 0.1749330759048462, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_6>>authors>>authors_4>>Tong Liu and Lingling Lu": 0.17594647407531738, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_74>>authors>>authors_3>>Lianghao Xia and Chuxu Zhang": 0.17669963836669922, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_70>>authors>>authors_13>>Peng Zhang": 0.1777125597000122, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_133>>authors>>authors_3>>Xiaoyang Li": 0.1778932809829712, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_279>>authors>>authors_5>>Mingtao Zhang and Xiang Jing": 0.17848098278045654, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_26>>authors>>authors_1>>Xinping Zhao": 0.17852336168289185, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_320>>authors>>authors_2>>Jiqun Liu and Tetsuya Sakai": 0.17862552404403687}, "What is the focus of the paper 'Meta-Learning Based Knowledge Extrapolation for Temporal Knowledge Graph'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_7>>abstract>>In the last few years, the solution to Knowledge Graph (KG) completion via learning embeddings of entities and relations has attracted a surge of interest. Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.": 0.11319750547409058, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_6>>title>>Meta-Learning Based Knowledge Extrapolation for Temporal Knowledge Graph": 0.11980020999908447}, "What was the focus of the 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_1>>title>>The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things": 0.08345246315002441, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_4>>title>>Weighted Statistically Significant Pattern Mining": 0.08513742685317993, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_6>>title>>The Human-Centric Metaverse: A Survey": 0.08945554494857788, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_3>>authors>>authors_4>>Philip S.

Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM) is the task of finding useful patterns that statistically occur more often from databases for one class than for another. The existing SSPM task does not consider the weight of each item. While in the real world, the significant level of different items/objects is various. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Weighted Statistically Significant Patterns Mining (WSSPM) problem and propose a novel WSSpm algorithm to successfully solve it. We present a new framework that effectively mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. We also propose a new weighted support threshold that can satisfy the demand of WSSPM and prove its correctness and completeness. Besides, our weighted support threshold and modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range. Finally, experimental results on several real datasets show that the WSSpm algorithm performs well in terms of execution time and memory storage.": 0.1093485951423645}, "What is the purpose of DSNet in video salient object detection for IoT and WoT applications?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_5>>abstract>>The most challenging aspects of deploying deep models in IoT and embedded systems are extensive computational complexity and large training and inference time. Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect).

As the concept of the Metaverse grows in popularity, many scholars and developers begin to focus on the Metaverse’s ethics and core. This paper argues that the Metaverse should be centered on humans. That is, humans constitute the majority of the Metaverse. As a result, we begin this paper by introducing the Metaverse’s origins, characteristics, related technologies, and the concept of the human-centric Metaverse (HCM). Second, we discuss the manifestation of human-centric in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss some current issues in the construction of HCM. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the applications of human-centric technologies in the Metaverse, as well as the relevant HCM application scenarios.

From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the situations that arouse out of the pandemic were so incongruous to the world we knew that even factual statements often had a humorous reaction. In this paper, we present a dataset of 2510 samples hand-annotated with labels such as humor style, type, theme, target and stereotypes formed or exploited while creating the humor in addition to 909 memes. Our dataset comprises Reddit posts, comments, Onion news headlines, real news headlines, and tweets. We evaluate the task of humor detection and maladaptive humor detection on state-of-the-art models namely RoBERTa and GPT-3. The finetuned models trained on our dataset show significant gains over zero-shot models including GPT-3 when detecting humor. Even though GPT-3 is good at generating meaningful explanations, we observed that it fails to detect maladaptive humor due to the absence of overt targets and profanities. We believe that the presented dataset will be helpful in designing computational methods for topical humor processing as it provides a unique sample set to study the theory of incongruity in a post-pandemic world.

The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. In this work, we conduct a case study approaching this problem with semi-supervised learning using a large language model (LLM). We select Reddit as the target social media platform due to its broad coverage of topics and content types. Our pipeline first generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while training the student model using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.": 0.13927125930786133, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_4>>title>>LLMs to the Moon?

The computational methods used in social network analysis have opened the way for new approaches to be used to understand the psychological and social processes that occur when users take part in online social movements or digital activism. The research in this paper takes an interdisciplinary approach bridging social identity and deindividuation theories to show how shared, individual social identities merge into a collective identity using computational techniques. We demonstrate a novel approach to evaluating the emergence of collective identity by measuring: 1) the statistical similarity of discussion topics within online communities and 2) the strength of these communities by examining network modularity and assortative properties of the network. To accomplish this, we examined the online connective action campaign of the #stopthesteal movement that emerged during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Our dataset consisted of 838,395 tweets posted by 178,296 users collected from January 04, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The results show that the network becomes more cohesive and topic similarity increases within communities leading up to and just after the elections (event 1) and the U.S. Capitol riot (event 2). Taking this multi-method approach of measuring content and network structure over time helps researchers and social scientists understand the emergence of a collective community as it is being constructed. The use of computational methods to study collective identity formation can help researchers identify the behaviors and social dynamics emerging from this type of cyber-collective movement that often serve as catalysts for these types of events. Finally, this research offers a new way to assess the psycho-social drivers of participant behaviors in cyber collective action.": 0.1575203537940979}, "What does the paper 'Claim Extraction and Dynamic Stance Detection in COVID-19 Tweets' propose to do?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_9>>abstract>>The information ecosystem today is noisy, and rife with messages that contain a mix of objective claims and subjective remarks or reactions. Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks. Due to the deluge of such messages on social media, and their tremendous power to shape our perceptions, there has never been a greater need to automate these analyses, which play a pivotal role in fact-checking, opinion mining, understanding opinion trends, and other such downstream tasks of social consequence. In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.": 0.16242563724517822, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_9>>title>>Claim Extraction and Dynamic Stance Detection in COVID-19 Tweets": 0.16312921047210693}, "Where will both the WebConf2023 and WebSci'23 take place?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>Venue>>Both the WebConf2023 and WebSci’23 will take place at: AT&T Hotel and Conference Center at The University of Texas at Austin 1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705": 0.11391347646713257, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>desciption>>This year, ACM WebSci’23 is co-located with The Web Conference.

WASPur, a tool to automatically identify the purposes of WebAssembly functions. To build this tool, we first construct an extensive collection of WebAssembly samples that represent the state of WebAssembly. Second, we analyze the dataset and identify the diverse use cases of the collected WebAssembly modules. We leverage the dataset of WebAssembly modules to construct semantics-aware intermediate representations (IR) of the functions in the modules. We encode the function IR for use in a machine learning classifier, and we find that this classifier can predict the similarity of a given function against known named functions with an accuracy rate of 88.07%. We hope our tool will enable inspection of optimized and minified WebAssembly modules that remove function names and most other semantic identifiers.": 0.14819467067718506, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_18>>authors>>authors_4>>Wei Hu and Gong Cheng": 0.15294837951660156, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_268>>authors>>authors_6>>Israel Nir and Udi Weinsberg": 0.16362881660461426, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_12>>authors>>authors_6>>Jiawei Sheng and Jianxin Li": 0.16635286808013916, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_11>>authors>>authors_3>>Dimitrios Skoutas": 0.16754543781280518}, "What are some of the topics covered in the accepted papers of the Research Track?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_257>>authors>>authors_1>>Yulin Yu": 0.11815333366394043, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_14>>title>>Unified Vision-Language Representation Modeling for E-Commerce Same-Style Products Retrieval": 0.1229482889175415, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_31>>title>>Robust Mid-Pass Filtering Graph Convolutional Networks": 0.12529277801513672, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_252>>authors>>authors_2>>Justin Cheng and Robert West": 0.12557929754257202, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_264>>title>>Understanding the Behaviors of Toxic Accounts on Reddit": 0.12689906358718872, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_183>>title>>Toward Open-domain Slot Filling via Self-supervised Co-training": 0.1274680495262146, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_9>>title>>Learning Multi-Stage Multi-Grained Semantic Embeddings for E-Commerce Search": 0.12794554233551025, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_274>>authors>>authors_3>>Shubham Agarwal": 0.12900108098983765, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Topics>>Topics_1>>Web query and document analysis, representation and understanding": 0.12990498542785645, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_132>>authors>>authors_1>>Yuxin Ying": 0.1305387020111084, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_53>>title>>Expressive and Efficient Representation Learning for Ranking Links in Temporal Graphs": 0.13110780715942383, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_45>>title>>TIGER: Temporal Interaction Graph Embedding with Restarts": 0.13128536939620972, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_157>>authors>>authors_4>>Negar Rahmati": 0.13146841526031494, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_38>>title>>Label Information Enhanced Fraud Detection against Low Homophily in Graphs": 0.13158631324768066}, "Who are authors of the last in the list of accepted papers for WWW2023 in the research tracks?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_164>>authors>>authors_5>>Kai Zhang and X.

One such problem faced by e-commerce platforms is Return To Origin (RTO), where the user cancels an order while it is in transit for delivery. In such a scenario platform faces logistics and opportunity costs. Traditionally, models trained on historical trends are used to predict the propensity of an order becoming RTO. Sociology literature has highlighted clear correlations between socio-economic indicators and users’ tendency to exploit systems to gain financial advantage. Social media profiles have information about location, education, and profession which have been shown to be an estimator of socio-economic condition. We believe combining social media data with e-commerce information can lead to improvements in a variety of tasks like RTO, recommendation, fraud detection, and credit modeling. In our proposed system, we find the public social profile of an e-commerce user and extract socio-economic features. Internal data fused with extracted social features are used to train a RTO order detection model. Our system demonstrates a performance improvement in RTO detection of 3.1% and 19.9% on precision and recall, respectively.

This task is not trivial as often there can be a mismatch between the user’s intent and the product inventory for various reasons, the most prevalent being: (i) the buyers and sellers use different vocabularies, which leads to a mismatch; (ii) the inventory doesn’t contain products that match the user’s intent. To build a successful e-commerce platform it is of paramount importance to be able to address both of these challenges. To do so, query rewriting approaches are used, which try to bridge the semantic gap between the user’s intent and the available product inventory. Such approaches use a combination of query token dropping, replacement and expansion. In this work we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-enhanced neural query rewriting in the e-commerce domain. We use a relationship-rich product Knowledge Graph to infuse auxiliary knowledge in a transformer-based query rewriting deep neural network. Experiments on two tasks, query pruning and complete query rewriting, show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline BERT-based query rewriting solution.": 0.14135557413101196}, "Why is there a need to improve Season-Aware Query-Product Semantic Similarity in product search for online shopping?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)_3>>abstract>>Product search for online shopping should be season-aware, i.e., presenting seasonally relevant products to customers. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution to improve seasonal relevance in product search by incorporating seasonality into language models for semantic matching. We first identify seasonal queries and products by analyzing implicit seasonal contexts through time-series analysis over the past year. Then we introduce explicit seasonal contexts by enhancing the query representation with a season token according to when the query is issued. A new season-enhanced BERT model (SE-BERT) is also proposed to learn the semantic similarity between the resulting seasonal queries and products. SE-BERT utilizes Multi-modal Adaption Gate (MAG) to augment the season-enhanced semantic embedding with other contextual information such as product price and review counts for robust relevance prediction. To better align with the ranking objective, a listwise loss function (neural NDCG) is used to regularize learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms existing solutions for query-product relevance prediction in terms of NDCG and Price Weighted Purchases (PWP).": 0.116263747215271}, "What are the key objectives in designing payment mechanisms in crowdsourcing contexts according to the research presented at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>We welcome submissions that address the broad goals of this Research Track, and look forward to seeing the diverse ways in which authors will approach these themes>>CrowdsourcingEthics>>Transparency, fairness, and ethics of crowdsourcing practices (please also read the CFP of the 'Crowdsourcing and Human Computation' track)": 0.13394349813461304, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_7>>abstract>>We consider the crowdsourcing setting where, in response to the assigned tasks, agents strategically decide both how much effort to exert (from a continuum) and whether to manipulate their reports.

In classic auction theory, only the auctioneer (i.e., the platform) and buyers (i.e., the advertisers) are involved, while the advertising audiences are ignored. For ecommerce advertising, however, the platform can provide coupons for the advertising audiences and nudge them into purchasing more products at lower prices (e.g., 2 dollars off the regular price). Such promotions can lead to an increase in amount and value of purchases. In this paper, we jointly design the coupon value computation, slot allocation, and payment of online advertising in an auto-bidding world. Firstly, we propose the auction mechanism, named CFA-auction (i.e., Coupon-For-the-Audiences-auction), which takes advertising audiences into account in the auction design. We prove the existence of pacing equilibrium, and show that CFA-auction satisfies the IC (incentive compatibility), IR (individual rationality) constraints. Then, we study the optimality of CFA-auction, and prove it can maintain an approximation of the optimal.

In this work, we consider both binary feedback (the learner can only observe whether she wins or not) and full information feedback (the learner can observe mt) models of the learner. For binary feedback, when the noise distribution is (partially) known, we propose a bidding algorithm that achieves at most regret, where Δ is a constant reserve in first price auctions.1 For the full information feedback with unknown noise distribution, we provide an algorithm that achieves regret at most .

The computational methods used in social network analysis have opened the way for new approaches to be used to understand the psychological and social processes that occur when users take part in online social movements or digital activism. The research in this paper takes an interdisciplinary approach bridging social identity and deindividuation theories to show how shared, individual social identities merge into a collective identity using computational techniques. We demonstrate a novel approach to evaluating the emergence of collective identity by measuring: 1) the statistical similarity of discussion topics within online communities and 2) the strength of these communities by examining network modularity and assortative properties of the network. To accomplish this, we examined the online connective action campaign of the #stopthesteal movement that emerged during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Our dataset consisted of 838,395 tweets posted by 178,296 users collected from January 04, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The results show that the network becomes more cohesive and topic similarity increases within communities leading up to and just after the elections (event 1) and the U.S. Capitol riot (event 2). Taking this multi-method approach of measuring content and network structure over time helps researchers and social scientists understand the emergence of a collective community as it is being constructed. The use of computational methods to study collective identity formation can help researchers identify the behaviors and social dynamics emerging from this type of cyber-collective movement that often serve as catalysts for these types of events. Finally, this research offers a new way to assess the psycho-social drivers of participant behaviors in cyber collective action.": 0.17055034637451172}, "What could potentially be the subject matter of 'The Internet with Privacy Policies: Measuring The Web Upon Consent'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_39>>title>>The Internet with Privacy Policies: Measuring The Web Upon Consent": 0.14858412742614746, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>We welcome submissions that address the broad goals of this Research Track, and look forward to seeing the diverse ways in which authors will approach these themes>>HarmsMeasurement>>Frameworks, taxonomies, and measurements of harms resulting from the deployment and use of web technologies (e.g., how do we measure representational harms on the web?)": 0.15623527765274048, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_19>>title>>Not Seen, Not Heard in the Digital World!

However, existing detection methods in the audio area exclusively work in English, and there is a lack of data resources in other languages. Cross-lingual deepfake detection, a critical but rarely explored area, urges more study. This paper conducts the first comprehensive study on the cross-lingual perspective of deepfake detection. We observe that English data enriched in deepfake algorithms can teach a detector the knowledge of various spoofing artifacts, contributing to performing detection across language domains. Based on the observation, we first construct a first-of-its-kind cross-lingual evaluation dataset including heterogeneous spoofed speech uttered in the two most widely spoken languages, then explored domain adaptation (DA) techniques to transfer the artifacts detection capability and propose effective and practical DA strategies fitting the cross-lingual scenario. Our adversarial-based DA paradigm teaches the model to learn real/fake knowledge while losing language dependency.

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.": 0.1340256929397583, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_297>>title>>HTTP Steady Connections for Robust Web Acceleration": 0.17125272750854492, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Security, Privacy & Trust Track>>Topics>>Topics_11>>Human and usability factors": 0.17137742042541504}, "Who are the authors of the paper titled 'Robust Recommendation with Adversarial Gaussian Data Augmentation'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_71>>authors>>authors_6>>Evgeny Kharlamov and Jie Tang": 0.18127143383026123, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_43>>authors>>authors_4>>Haonan Yuan": 0.182819664478302, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_357>>authors>>authors_5>>Da Zheng": 0.1831532120704651, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_59>>authors>>authors_5>>Tianchi Yang and Junping Du": 0.18365180492401123, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_26>>authors>>authors_2>>Bingbing Xu": 0.18379813432693481, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_26>>authors>>authors_4>>Li Xu": 0.18525463342666626, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems_6>>authors>>authors_3>>Borja Ocejo": 0.18551772832870483, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_265>>authors>>authors_3>>Douglas N.

information on the web has become a preferred way for healthcare consumers to support their information needs. Generally, healthcare consumers use long and detailed questions with several peripheral details to express their healthcare concerns, contributing to natural language understanding challenges. One way to address this challenge is by summarizing the questions. However, most of the existing abstractive summarization systems generate impeccably fluent yet factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary. Our extensive experimental results on two benchmark consumer health question summarization datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method by achieving state-of-the-art performance and generating factually correct and fluent summaries, as measured by human evaluation.": 0.15056568384170532, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and

limited resources, and both edge service providers (ESPs) and edge service consumers (ESCs) can benefit significantly from it. Existing paradigms of workload forecasting (i.e., edge-only or cloud-only) are improper, due to failing to consider the inter-site correlations and might suffer from significant data transmission delays. With the increasing adoption of edge platforms by web services, it is critical to balance both accuracy and efficiency in workload forecasting. In this paper, we propose ELASTIC, which is the first study that leverages a cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for edge workload forecasting with multi-view graphs. Specifically, at the global stage, we design a learnable aggregation layer on each edge site to reduce the time consumption while capturing the inter-site correlation. Additionally, at the local stage, we design a disaggregation layer combining both the intra-site correlation and inter-site correlation to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on realistic edge workload datasets collected from China’s largest edge service provider show that ELASTIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, decreases time consumption, and reduces communication cost.": 0.1324080228805542, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_8>>authors>>authors_10>>Zhenyu Wu and Dan Pei": 0.13406974077224731}, "What is the paper written by authors Klaus-Tycho Foerster, Thibault Marette, Stefan Neumann, Claudia Plant, Ylli Sadikaj, Stefan Schmid and Yllka Velaj about?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_320>>authors>>authors_2>>Jiqun Liu and Tetsuya Sakai": 0.16160768270492554, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_127>>authors>>authors_3>>Markel Vigo and Simon Harper": 0.16214412450790405, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_202>>authors>>authors_1>>Paschalis Bekos": 0.1630263328552246, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_245>>authors>>authors_4>>Saeid Hosseini and Xiaofang Zhou": 0.16336309909820557, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_29>>authors>>authors_3>>Xinping Yi and Rui Zhang": 0.16343384981155396, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_164>>authors>>authors_5>>Kai Zhang and X.

Proposals>>description>>We invite contributions to the Industry Track to be held at The Web Conference 2023 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place online, hosted at Austin, USA, on April 30 - May 4, 2023.\nThe Web has proven to be a fertile ground for industrial research, and companies from small to large, from brand new to long established, are making an ongoing impact on the state of the art in science and engineering. The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library. Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

The proposed method specifies a statistical design, a sampling algorithm, and a technological setup for data collection through web crawling. The statistical design reduces the dimensionality of the problem and ensures that the data collected are representative, variation-rich, and suitable for the investigation of the causes behind any observed disparities. Implementations of the method can collect data on algorithmic decisions, such as price, recommendations, and delivery fees that can be matched to website visitor demographic data from established sources such as censuses and large scale surveys. The combined data can be used to investigate the presence and causes of disparate impact, potentially helping online retailers audit their algorithms without collecting or holding the demographic data of their users. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of the automated pricing decisions of a leading retailer in the United States. A custom-built platform implemented the method to collect data for nearly 20,000 different grocery products at more than 3,000 randomly-selected zip codes. The data collected indicates that prices are higher for locations with high proportions of minority households. Although these price disparities can be partly attributed to algorithmic biases, they are mainly explained by local factors and therefore can be regarded as business necessities.": 0.1778104305267334,

However, as centralized data providers, their reliability remains under-studied. As a case study, we investigate Beaconcha.in , a leading explorer serving Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) update. According to the explorer, we find that more than 75% of slashable Byzantine actions were not slashed. Since Ethereum relies on the “stake-and-slash\" mechanism to align incentives, this finding would at its face value cause concern over Ethereum’s security. However, further investigation reveals that all the apparent unslashed incidents were erroneously recorded due to the explorer’s mishandling of consensus edge cases.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving. Understanding the global landscape surrounding tax evasion opportunities in decentralized finance represents a first step at preventing corporate capital flight of cryptocurrencies.": 0.07738614082336426}, "What is the issue investigated in the 'Ready, Aim, Snipe!

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment. Finally, we analyze token smart contracts to identify mechanisms that can hinder sniper bots.": 0.11925256252288818}, "How does the 'Regime-based Implied Stochastic Volatility Model for Crypto Option Pricing' contribute to the field of digital asset options?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd International Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd International Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW)_5>>abstract>>The increasing adoption of Digital Assets (DAs), such as Bitcoin (BTC), raises the need for accurate option pricing models. Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.":

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing.

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”.

To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential.":

Currently, knowledge hypergraph link prediction methods are essentially simple extensions of those used in knowledge graphs, where n-ary relational facts are decomposed into different subelements. Convolutional neural networks have been shown to have remarkable information extraction capabilities in previous work on knowledge graph link prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding-based knowledge hypergraph link prediction model named HyConvE, which exploits the powerful learning ability of convolutional neural networks for effective link prediction. Specifically, we employ 3D convolution to capture the deep interactions of entities and relations to efficiently extract explicit and implicit knowledge in each n-ary relational fact without compromising its translation property. In addition, appropriate relation and position-aware filters are utilized sequentially to perform two-dimensional convolution operations to capture the intrinsic patterns and position information in each n-ary relation, respectively. Extensive experimental results on real datasets of knowledge hypergraphs and knowledge graphs demonstrate the superior performance of HyConvE compared with state-of-the-art baselines.":

However, due to the recent trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, several frameworks have been proposed such as Model Cards, and Data Cards, among others, to help in the appropriate re-usage of those models and datasets. In addition, because of the introduction of the dataspace concept for similar datasets in one place, there is potential that similar Model Cards, Data Cards, Service Cards, and Dataspace Cards can be linked to extract helpful information for better decision-making about which model and data can be used for a specific application. This paper reviews the case for considering a Semantic Web approach for exchanging Model/Data Cards as Linked Data or knowledge graphs in a dataspace, making them machine-readable. We discuss the basic concepts and propose a schema for linking Data Cards and Model Cards within a dataspace. In addition, we introduce the concept of a dataspace card which can be a starting point for extracting knowledge about models and datasets in a dataspace.

However, existing methods are mainly built upon uniform Euclidean space, which has been found to be conflict with the power-law distributions of real-world graphs and unable to represent the hierarchical connections between nodes effectively. With respect to the special data characteristic, hyperbolic geometry offers an ideal alternative due to its exponential expansion property. In this paper, we propose HGWaveNet, a novel hyperbolic graph neural network that fully exploits the fitness between hyperbolic spaces and data distributions for temporal link prediction. Specifically, we design two key modules to learn the spatial topological structures and temporal evolutionary information separately. On the one hand, a hyperbolic diffusion graph convolution (HDGC) module effectively aggregates information from a wider range of neighbors. On the other hand, the internal order of causal correlation between historical states is captured by hyperbolic dilated causal convolution (HDCC) modules. The whole model is built upon the hyperbolic spaces to preserve the hierarchical structural information in the entire data flow. To prove the superiority of HGWaveNet, extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world graph datasets and the results show a relative improvement by up to 6.67% on AUC for temporal link prediction over SOTA methods.": 0.187156081199646, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_1>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/nctQdDkFsEM": 0.18888992071151733, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_12>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGsbGy7wz9A": 0.18929249048233032, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_23>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OAlQpcfNTU": 0.19004541635513306, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_26>>title>>When Sparse Meets Dense: Learning Advanced Graph Neural Networks with DGL-Sparse Package": 0.19014084339141846}, "Is there a provided video for the tutorial 'Model Monitoring in Practice: Lessons Learned and Open Challenges'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_17>>title>>Model Monitoring in Practice: Lessons Learned and Open Challenges": 0.15828800201416016, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_20>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/oj3Rln7mBww": 0.18809717893600464, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_28>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0MxgKBkGyY": 0.1881018877029419, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_8>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypvje1tGONc": 0.18878358602523804, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_22>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvmZwuya2yQ": 0.1888284683227539, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_22>>website>>https://www.dropbox.com/s/623ew32xg74kvjv/videoGraphOOD.mp4?dl=0": 0.18902188539505005, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_10>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/oS0KR7IdLe0": 0.18983018398284912, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_7>>website>>https://github.com/the-praxis-initiative/comparative-ontology-modeling": 0.19151806831359863, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_7>>title>>Same Data, Different Model: Choosing an Ontology Modeling Methodology": 0.1930469274520874, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_24>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/ovw7093ogeI": 0.19341176748275757, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_26>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Zmxnk4OuRQ": 0.1942843198776245, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_13>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/GkTOchT0tYc": 0.19443345069885254, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_15>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/pn3yfmDAIgk": 0.19465500116348267, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_5>>video>>https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Sc-Mr-GctU": 0.1951465606689453}, "What is the website link for the tutorial 'Never-Ending Learning, Lifelong Learning and Continual Learning in the Era of Large Pre-Trained Language Models'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_19>>title>>Never-Ending Learning, Lifelong Learning and Continual Learning in the Era of Large Pre-Trained Language Models": 0.10907495021820068, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_7>>website>>https://github.com/the-praxis-initiative/comparative-ontology-modeling": 0.17660194635391235, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_12>>abstract>>Continual few-shot learning, as a paradigm that simultaneously solves continual learning and few-shot learning, has become a challenging problem in machine learning. An eligible continual few-shot learning model is expected to distinguish all seen classes upon new categories arriving, where each category only includes very few labeled data. However, existing continual few-shot learning methods only consider the visual modality, where the distributions of new categories often indistinguishably overlap with old categories, thus resulting in the severe catastrophic forgetting problem. To tackle this problem, in this paper we study continual few-shot learning with the assistance of semantic knowledge by simultaneously taking both visual modality and semantic concepts of categories into account. We propose a Continual few-shot learning algorithm with Semantic knowledge Regularization (CoSR) for adapting to the distribution changes of visual prototypes through a Transformer-based prototype adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the original visual prototypes from the backbone are fed into the well-designed Transformer with corresponding semantic concepts, where the semantic concepts are extracted from all categories. The semantic-level regularization forces the categories with similar semantics to be closely distributed, while the opposite ones are constrained to be far away from each other. The semantic regularization improves the model’s ability to distinguish between new and old categories, thus significantly mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, CUB200 and an industrial dataset with long-tail distribution demonstrate the advantages of our CoSR model compared with state-of-the-art methods.": 0.1785227656364441, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587648": 0.17886734008789062}}
