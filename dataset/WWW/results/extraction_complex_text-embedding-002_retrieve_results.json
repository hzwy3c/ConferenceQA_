These methods adopt a two-tower framework to learn embedding vectors for query and item separately and thus leverage efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to retrieve relevant items. However, existing EBR methods usually ignore inconsistent user behaviors in industrial multi-stage search systems, resulting in insufficient retrieval efficiency with a low commercial return. To tackle this challenge, we propose to improve EBR methods by learning Multi-level Multi-Grained Semantic Embeddings (MMSE). We propose the multi-stage information mining to exploit the ordered, clicked, unclicked and random sampled items in practical user behavior data, and then capture query-item similarity via a post-fusion strategy. We then propose multi-grained learning objectives that integrate the retrieval loss with global comparison ability and the ranking loss with local comparison ability to generate semantic embeddings. Both experiments on a real-world billion-scale dataset and online A/B tests verify the effectiveness of MMSE in achieving significant performance improvements on metrics such as offline recall and online conversion rate (CVR).": 0.114979088306427, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Keynotes>>SESSION: Keynotes_3>>title>>Concept Regulation in the Social Sciences": 0.11540138721466064}, "Who are the organizers behind WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_3>>organizers>>organizers_1>>Johannes Theissen-Lipp": 0.10762697458267212, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_12>>organizers>>organizers_4>>Sarah Dean": 0.10896158218383789, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_15>>organizers>>organizers_8>>Qi Wang": 0.11195838451385498, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_12>>organizers>>organizers_3>>Xiquan Cui": 0.11261332035064697, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_12>>organizers>>organizers_1>>Da Xu": 0.11357980966567993, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_20>>organizers>>organizers_1>>Mirko Polato": 0.11453855037689209, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_18>>organizers>>organizers_1>>Bernhard Haslhofer": 0.11461502313613892, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_7>>organizers>>organizers_1>>Eva Blomqvist": 0.11546015739440918, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_12>>organizers>>organizers_2>>Tobias Schnabel": 0.11704814434051514, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_4>>organizers>>organizers_6>>Enrico Daga": 0.11802297830581665, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_12>>organizers>>organizers_6>>Aniket Deshmukh": 0.11808180809020996, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Organizing Committee>>Program Committee Members>>PC Members>>PC Members_63>>Shubhanshu Mishra University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign": 0.11847317218780518, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_1>>organizers>>organizers_1>>Ugur Kursuncu": 0.11900389194488525, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_14>>organizers>>organizers_3>>Eyhab Al-Masri": 0.11988145112991333, "WWW2023>>calls>>Special Track>>CFP: Web4Good (Sustainable Development and Vulnerable Populations)>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_2>>affiliation>>Dataminr": 0.12045198678970337, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>GENERAL CHAIRS>>members>>members_3>>affiliation>>data.world": 0.1208881139755249}, "How do I register for the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Here>>https://cvent.me/MzwbQb": 0.11011886596679688, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Full Conference (5 days: April 30 -

To crack the code, you need to crack the culture that makes us who we are. Who and what is creative remains largely disconnected from diverse and global cultural norms, rendering existing technology suboptimal and even unusable to the world’s majority. Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation.
