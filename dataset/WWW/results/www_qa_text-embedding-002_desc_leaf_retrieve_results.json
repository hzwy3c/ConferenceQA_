For delivery systems, improving address resolution positively impacts multiple downstream systems such as geocoding, route planning and delivery time estimations, leading to an efficient and reliable delivery experience, both for customers as well as delivery agents. Our proposed approach jointly leverages address text, past delivery information and concepts from graph theory to retrieve informative and diverse record pairs to label. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach on manually curated dataset across addresses from India (IN) and United Arab Emirates (UAE). We achieved absolute improvement in recall on average across IN and UAE while preserving precision over the existing production system. We also introduce delivery point (DP) geocode learning for cold-start addresses as a downstream application of address resolution. In addition to offline evaluation, we also performed online A/B experiments which show that when the production model is augmented with active learnt record pairs, the delivery precision improved by and delivery defects reduced by on an average across shipments from IN and UAE.": 0.09896796941757202}, "Which study presents a new method for contrastive fine-tuning on few shot intent detection within a topological intent tree?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_28>>title>>Contrastive Fine-tuning on Few Shot Intent Detection with Topological Intent Tree": 0.10050523281097412, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_30>>abstract>>We present a few-shot intent detection model for an enterprise’s conversational dialogue system. The model uses an intent topological tree to guide the search for the user intent using large language models (LLMs). The intents are resolved based on semantic similarities between user utterances and the text descriptions of the internal nodes of the intent tree or the intent examples in the leaf nodes of the tree. Our results show that an off-the-shelf language model can work reasonably well in a large enterprise deployment without fine-tuning, and its performance can be further improved with fine-tuning as more domain-specific data becomes available. We also show that the fine-tuned language model meets and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in resolving conversation intents without training classifiers.

Its deployment also needs to consider challenges in scalability and downstream integration in order to translate modeling advances into better search result relevance. In this paper we present HierCat, the query categorization system at Facebook Marketplace. HierCat addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-task pre-training of dual-encoder architectures with a hierarchical inference step to effectively learn from weakly supervised training data mined from searcher engagement. We show that HierCat not only outperforms popular methods in offline experiments, but also leads to 1.4% improvement in NDCG and 4.3% increase in searcher engagement at Facebook Marketplace Search in

To crack the code, you need to crack the culture that makes us who we are.

Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation.

However, the indexes in vector quantization cannot be trained together with the inference models since data indexing is not differentiable. To this end, differentiable vector quantization approaches, such as DiffPQ and DeepPQ, have been recently proposed, but existing methods have two drawbacks. First, they do not impose any constraints on codebooks, such that the resultant codebooks lack diversity, leading to limited retrieval performance. Second, since data indexing resorts to operator, differentiability is usually achieved by either relaxation or Straight-Through Estimation (STE), which leads to biased gradient and slow convergence. To address these problems, we propose a Differentiable Optimized Product Quantization method (DOPQ) and beyond in this paper. Particularly, each data is projected into multiple orthogonal spaces, to generate multiple views of data. Thus, each codebook is learned with one view of data, guaranteeing the diversity of codebooks. Moreover, instead of simple differentiable relaxation, DOPQ optimizes the loss based on direct loss minimization, significantly reducing the gradient bias problem. Finally, DOPQ is evaluated with seven datasets of both recommendation and image search tasks. Extensive experimental results show that DOPQ outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.": 0.12200897932052612, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_19>>title>>Differentiable Optimized Product Quantization and Beyond": 0.1365184783935547, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_19>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583482": 0.1370183229446411}, "Who are the authors of the paper titled 'Optimizing Feature Set for Click-Through Rate Prediction'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_42>>authors>>authors_3>>Ting Zhang and Xin Miao": 0.15913736820220947, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_42>>authors>>authors_4>>Zhengxing Chen": 0.16058999300003052, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_1>>authors>>authors_3>>Jianling Wang and James Caverlee": 0.16067099571228027, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_7>>authors>>authors_9>>Xiangyu Zhao and Yongfeng Zhang": 0.16082918643951416, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_24>>authors>>authors_6>>Zhiqiang Zhang": 0.16088402271270752, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_9>>authors>>authors_7>>Enhong Chen and Xin Li": 0.16157126426696777, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_322>>authors>>authors_5>> Zhourong Chen": 0.16172844171524048, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_17>>authors>>authors_6>>Yonghua Wu and Marc Najork": 0.16263163089752197, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_12>>authors>>authors_4>>Jian Zhang and Jianping Fan": 0.1626569628715515, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_354>>authors>>authors_5>>Marcus Boyd and Jingrui He": 0.1627289056777954, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_25>>authors>>authors_1>>Jiaming Shen": 0.16294431686401367, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_127>>authors>>authors_3>>Markel Vigo and Simon Harper": 0.16385984420776367, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_26>>authors>>authors_8>>Zhong Ming and Xiuqiang He": 0.1639186143875122}, "What is the principle focus of the paper named 'Improving Content Retrievability in Search with Controllable Query Generation'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_3>>title>>Improving Content Retrievability in Search with Controllable Query Generation": 0.07394170761108398, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_300>>title>>Improving Content Retrievability in Search with Controllable Query Generation": 0.09221166372299194, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583265": 0.11792469024658203, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_3>>title>>Improving Content Retrievability in Search with Controllable Query Generation": 0.11864525079727173}, "What is the proposed solution in 'Zero-shot Clarifying Question Generation for Conversational Search'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_13>>title>>Zero-shot Clarifying Question Generation for Conversational Search": 0.09610313177108765, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_16>>abstract>>In this work, we innovatively explore generating clarifying questions in a zero-shot setting to overcome the cold start problem and we propose a constrained clarifying question generation system which uses both question templates and query facets to guide the effective and precise question generation.

Asking clarifying questions in conversational search has been widely studied and considered an effective solution to resolve query ambiguity. Existing work have explored various approaches for clarifying question ranking and generation. However, due to the lack of real conversational search data, they have to use artificial datasets for training, which limits their generalizability to real-world search scenarios. As a result, the industry has shown reluctance to implement them in reality, further suspending the availability of real conversational search interaction data. The above dilemma can be formulated as a cold start problem of clarifying question generation and conversational search in general. Furthermore, even if we do have large-scale conversational logs, it is not realistic to gather training data that can comprehensively cover all possible queries and topics in open-domain search scenarios. The risk of fitting bias when training a clarifying question retrieval/generation model on incomprehensive dataset is thus another important challenge.": 0.12145572900772095}, "What issue does the paper 'Learning Denoised and Interpretable Session Representation for Conversational Search' address?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_301>>title>>Learning Denoised and Interpretable Session Representation for Conversational Search": 0.0865025520324707, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_4>>title>>Learning Denoised and Interpretable Session Representation for Conversational Search": 0.09007668495178223, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583265": 0.09011393785476685, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_4>>title>>Learning Denoised and Interpretable Session Representation for Conversational Search": 0.09929776191711426}, "What is the title of the paper written by Emyn Dean for the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_9>>authors>>authors_1>>Emyn Dean": 0.09958285093307495, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_300>>authors>>authors_1>>Gustavo Penha": 0.11459797620773315, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_202>>authors>>authors_2>>Panagiotis Papadopoulos": 0.11485171318054199, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_30>>authors>>authors_2>>Dian Tang": 0.11644911766052246, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_19>>authors>>authors_7>>Eunyee Koh": 0.11865824460983276, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_145>>authors>>authors_3>>Xiangnan He": 0.11867594718933105, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Keynotes>>SESSION: Keynotes_4>>authors>>authors_1>>Michalis Vazirgiannis": 0.11875587701797485, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_38>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587336": 0.11886286735534668, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_189>>authors>>authors_2>>Chuan Ma": 0.1189260482788086, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_263>>authors>>authors_1>>Christina Yeung": 0.11953264474868774, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_235>>authors>>authors_4>>Theodore Dalamagas": 0.12032192945480347, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_271>>authors>>authors_5>>Huai Jiang": 0.1205936074256897, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_235>>authors>>authors_1>>Serafeim Chatzopoulos": 0.12062793970108032}, "What neural network technique was used in Victoria Firsanova's research for building a mobile app for people on the spectrum?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_1>>abstract>>The inclusion of autistic people can be augmented by a mobile app that provides information without a human mediator making information perception more liberating for people in the spectrum.

Existing attack detection methods rely on the learning of malicious samples, so it is difficult to detect new attacks and long-period attacks. This paper transforms the DNS data flow into time series, and proposes a DNS anomaly detection method based on graph attention network and graph embedding (GAT-DNS). GAT-DNS establishes a multivariate time series model to depict the DNS service status. When the actual flow of a feature exceeds the predicted range, it is considered that abnormal DNS behavior is found. In this paper, vertex dependency is proposed to describe the dependency between features. The features with high vertex dependency values are deleted to achieve model compression. This improves the system efficiency. Experiments on open data sets show that compared with the latest AD-Bop and QLAD methods, GAT-DNS method not only improves the precision, recall and F1 value, but also improves the time efficiency of the model.": 0.1664772629737854}, "What are the roles of Liane Lewin-Eytan, Suzan Verberne, and Michael Bendersky in The Web Conference (WWW2023) Search Track?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>name>>Michael Bendersky": 0.09907644987106323, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_2>>personal homepage>>https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~verbernes/": 0.10350602865219116, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>affiliation>>Google, United States": 0.10434293746948242, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_2>>name>>Suzan Verberne": 0.10771143436431885, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>name>>Liane Lewin-Eytan": 0.11008977890014648, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_2>>affiliation>>Leiden University, the Netherlands": 0.11088109016418457, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>personal homepage>>https://www.amazon.science/author/liane-lewin-eytan": 0.11516577005386353, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>affiliation>>Amazon, Israel": 0.11915981769561768, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_13>>authors>>authors_5>>Ming Wu and Qingyao Ai": 0.1222725510597229, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>personal homepage>>https://bendersky.github.io/": 0.12273025512695312, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_10>>authors>>authors_3>>Laura Edelson": 0.12657755613327026, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track name>>Search Track": 0.1273268461227417, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_14>>authors>>authors_3>>Xiao Liu": 0.1278831958770752, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_7>>authors>>authors_3>>Jyun-Yu Jiang": 0.12842345237731934, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.12895512580871582}, "What is the contact information for the Search Track of The Web Conference (WWW2023)?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Contact>>search-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.08544284105300903, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.08838266134262085, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>ConferenceSeries>>formerly known as WWW": 0.09178280830383301, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Track name>>Search Track": 0.09497517347335815, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Search Track>>Note>>Authors should consult the conference’s main Research Track CFP to ensure their submissions are aligned with broader conference expectations, scope, and theme: “Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility”.

widely adopted in almost all domains, from threat recognition to medical diagnosis. Albeit its supreme model accuracy, DL imposes a heavy burden on devices as it incurs overwhelming system overhead to execute DL models, especially on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge devices. Collaborative inference is a promising approach to supporting DL models, by which the data owner (the victim) runs the first layers of the model on her local device and then a cloud provider (the adversary) runs the remaining layers of the model. Compared to offloading the entire model to the cloud, the collaborative inference approach is more data privacy-preserving as the owner’s model input is not exposed to outsiders. However, we show in this paper that the adversary can restore the victim’s model input by exploiting the output of the victim’s local model. Our attack is dubbed Ginver 1: Generative model inversion attacks against collaborative inference. Once trained, Ginver can infer the victim’s unseen model inputs without remaking the inversion attack model and thus has the generative capability. We extensively evaluate Ginver under different settings (e.g., white-box and black-box of the victim’s local model) and applications (e.g., CIFAR10 and FaceScrub datasets). The experimental results show that Ginver recovers high-quality images from the victims.": 0.10532546043395996, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_15>>title>>Ginver: Generative Model Inversion Attacks Against Collaborative Inference": 0.10876822471618652}, "What is the main focus of the paper 'Bad Apples: Understanding the Centralized Security Risks in Decentralized Ecosystems'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_29>>title>>Bad Apples: Understanding the Centralized Security Risks in Decentralized Ecosystems": 0.08115148544311523, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_29>>title>>Bad Apples: Understanding the Centralized Security Risks in Decentralized Ecosystems": 0.08718037605285645, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_29>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583393": 0.12245702743530273, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_37>>abstract>>The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.": 0.14256525039672852}, "In the BERT4ETH: A Pre-trained Transformer for Ethereum Fraud Detection study, what were some of the serious vulnerabilities found?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_26>>title>>The Chameleon on the Web: an Empirical Study of the Insidious Proactive Web Defacements": 0.09183931350708008, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_26>>abstract>>As various forms of fraud proliferate on Ethereum, it is imperative to safeguard against these malicious activities to protect susceptible users from being victimized. While current studies solely rely on graph-based fraud detection approaches, it is argued that they may not be well-suited for dealing with highly repetitive, skew-distributed and heterogeneous Ethereum transactions. To address these challenges, we propose BERT4ETH, a universal pre-trained Transformer encoder that serves as an account representation extractor for detecting various fraud behaviors on Ethereum. BERT4ETH features the superior modeling capability of Transformer to capture the dynamic sequential patterns inherent in Ethereum transactions, and addresses the challenges of pre-training a BERT model for Ethereum with three practical and effective strategies, namely repetitiveness reduction, skew alleviation and heterogeneity modeling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that BERT4ETH outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant enhancements in terms of the phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks.

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.": 0.13753360509872437}, "What is the title of the paper authored by Ramesh Gorantla and

Applications and Smart Cities”, which started back in Florence in 2015 and kept on taking place every year in conjunction with the WWW conference series. Last year the workshop was held virtually in Lyon, France. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications’ role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing.

It is important to make conscious decisions to keep harmony in sustainability. There are multiple frameworks to evaluate how sustainability is measured and to understand how sustainable a place is, be it a city or a region, and one such framework is the Circles of Sustainability. Though these frameworks offer good solutions, it is a challenge to collect relevant data to make the framework widely usable. This paper focuses on this specific issue by utilizing the methodology introduced in the framework and applying it practically to better understand how sustainable our cities and society are. We present a unique web-based application which utilizes publicly accessible data to compute sustainability scores and rank for every city and presents the results in an intelligent and easy to comprehend visual interface. The paper also discusses the technical difficulties associated with creating such an application, including data collection, data processing, data integration, and scoring algorithm.

However, the complexity of fairness definitions and the proliferation of fairness metrics in research literature have led to a complex decision-making space. This environment makes it challenging for practitioners to operationalize and pick metrics that work within their unique context. This suggests that practitioners require more decision-making support, but it is not clear what type of support would be beneficial. We conducted a literature review of 24 papers to gather metrics introduced by the research community for measuring fairness in recommendation and ranking systems. We organized these metrics into a ‘decision-tree style’ support framework designed to help practitioners scope fairness objectives and identify fairness metrics relevant to their recommendation domain and application context. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using this framework to assess which challenges practitioners may face when scoping fairness objectives and metrics for their system, and which further support may be needed beyond such tools.": 0.07686138153076172}, "What is the main issue addressed in the paper 'Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)_10>>title>>Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations": 0.10177087783813477, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_351>>title>>Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations": 0.12076634168624878, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_76>>title>>On the Theories Behind Hard Negative Sampling for Recommendation": 0.12162363529205322, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_11>>abstract>>Pairwise learning strategies are prevalent for optimizing recommendation models on implicit feedback data, which usually learns user preference by discriminating between positive (i.e., clicked by a user) and negative items (i.e., obtained by negative sampling). However, the size of different item groups (specified by item attribute) is usually unevenly distributed. We empirically find that the commonly used uniform negative sampling strategy for pairwise algorithms (e.g., BPR) can inherit such data bias and oversample the majority item group as negative instances, severely countering group fairness on the item side. In this paper, we propose a Fairly adaptive Negative sampling approach (FairNeg), which improves item group fairness via adaptively adjusting the group-level negative sampling distribution in the training process. In particular, it first perceives the model’s unfairness status at each step and then adjusts the group-wise sampling distribution with an adaptive momentum update strategy for better facilitating fairness optimization. Moreover, a negative sampling distribution Mixup mechanism is proposed, which gracefully incorporates existing importance-aware sampling techniques intended for mining informative negative samples, thus allowing for achieving multiple optimization purposes.

In non-English speaking countries like India, Nepal and many others, the regional titles are transliterated from native language to English and are being searched in English. Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system.

This problem is aggravated when there is no behavioral data available for new content. Poor quality recommendation for these items lead to user dissatisfaction and short content shelf-life. In this paper we propose a solution MEMER (Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations), that utilises the multimodal semantic information of content and uses it to generate better quality embeddings for early-stage items. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by extending it to various explicit and implicit user actions. Using these learnt embeddings, we conduct offline and online experiments to verify its effectiveness. The predicted embeddings show significant gains in online early-stage experiments for both videos and images (videos:  44% relative gain in click through rate,  46% relative gain in explicit engagements,  9% relative gain in successful video play,  20% relative reduction in skips, images:  56% relative gain in explicit engagements).

An entity can be a person, organization, work-of-art, etc., while an event, such as the Opioid epidemic, occurs at specific point(s) in time. ELTE first extracts key-phrases from episode title and description metadata. It then uses entity linking to canonicalize them against Wikipedia knowledge base (KB), ensuring that the topics exist in the real world. ELTE also models NIL-predictions for entity or event topics that are not in the KB, as well as topics that are not of entity or event type. To test the model, we construct a podcast topic database of 1166 episodes from various categories. Each episode comes with a Wiki-link annotated main topic or NIL-prediction. ELTE produces the best overall Exact Match EM score of .84, with by-far the best EM of .89 among the entity or event type episodes, as well as NIL-predictions for episodes without entity or event main topic (EM score of .86).": 0.088176429271698, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media_5>>title>>MEMER - Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations": 0.11302435398101807, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587679": 0.14333713054656982, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media>>SESSION: Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media_4>>title>>Entity and Event Topic Extraction from Podcast Episode Title and Description Using Entity Linking": 0.14923173189163208}, "What is the title of the first paper presented in the Web & Society session at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_20>>authors>>authors_4>>Corrado Monti": 0.09751111268997192, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_17>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583543": 0.09989047050476074, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_20>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583267": 0.10088324546813965, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_20>>authors>>authors_1>>Arthur Capozzi": 0.10089313983917236, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_21>>authors>>authors_1>>Gabriel Magno": 0.1014091968536377, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Special Track: History of the Web>>SESSION: Special Track: History of the Web_6>>authors>>authors_1>>Steven Pemberton": 0.10319417715072632, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_6>>authors>>authors_1>>Bing He": 0.10322076082229614, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Keynotes>>SESSION: Keynotes_4>>authors>>authors_1>>Michalis Vazirgiannis": 0.10470068454742432, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Special Track: History of the Web>>SESSION: Special Track: History of the Web_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3585576": 0.10514688491821289, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_7>>authors>>authors_1>>Yin Gu": 0.10549122095108032}, "Who are the authors of the paper titled 'Reinforcement Learning-based Counter-Misinformation Response Generation: A Case Study of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_255>>title>>Reinforcement Learning-based Counter-Misinformation Response Generation: A Case Study of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation": 0.09233897924423218, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_6>>abstract>>The spread of online misinformation threatens public health, democracy, and the broader society.

Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos  accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios.": 0.14193624258041382}, "What is the abstract of the paper 'Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Ambiguous Query'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_234>>title>>Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Ambiguous Query": 0.07690989971160889, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_10>>title>>Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Ambiguous Query": 0.08452397584915161, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_10>>title>>Knowledge Graph Question Answering with Ambiguous Query": 0.10110211372375488, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_11>>abstract>>Knowledge graph question answering aims to identify answers of the query according to the facts in the knowledge graph. In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries. The inferred high quality queries will be returned to the users to help them search with ease. Moreover, all the high-quality candidate nodes will be re-ranked according to the inferred queries.

To understand complex questions, existing studies employ language models (LMs) to encode contexts. Despite the simplicity, they neglect the latent relational information among question concepts and answers in KGs. While question concepts ubiquitously present hyponymy at the semantic level, e.g., mammals and animals, this feature is identically reflected in the hierarchical relations in KGs, e.g., a_type_of. Therefore, we are motivated to explore comprehensive reasoning by the hierarchical structures in KGs to help understand questions. However, it is non-trivial to reason over tree-like structures compared with chained paths. Moreover, identifying appropriate hierarchies relies on expertise. To this end, we propose HamQA, a novel Hierarchy-aware multi-hop Question Answering framework on knowledge graphs, to effectively align the mutual hierarchical information between question contexts and KGs. The entire learning is conducted in Hyperbolic space, inspired by its advantages of embedding hierarchical structures. Specifically, (i) we design a context-aware graph attentive network to capture context information. (ii) Hierarchical structures are continuously preserved in KGs by minimizing the Hyperbolic geodesic distances. The comprehensive reasoning is conducted to jointly train both components and provide a top-ranked candidate as an optimal answer.

A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding.

Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign.

information of interest therein efficiently. In this paper, we propose a multi-step process to achieve the same. First, we explore the semantic sentence segmentation of SEBI case files via classification. We also propose a dataset of Indian legal adjudicating orders which contain tags from carefully crafted domain-specific sentence categories with the help of legal experts. We experiment with various machine learning and deep learning methods for this multi-class classification. Then, we examine the performance of numerous summarization methods on the segmented document to generate persona-specific summaries. Finally, we develop a pipeline making use of the best methods in both sub-tasks to achieve high recall.": 0.07464534044265747, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587611": 0.08164840936660767, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_5>>title>>Aspect-based Summarization of Legal Case Files using Sentence Classification": 0.09353476762771606, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_43>>title>>CitationSum: Citation-aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Scientific Paper Summarization": 0.16415101289749146, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_175>>title>>CitationSum: Citation-aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Scientific Paper Summarization": 0.16754275560379028}, "What is the main improvement the authors hope to achieve with their Semantic-Oriented Hierarchical Graph in the financial domain?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_3>>title>>SoarGraph: Numerical Reasoning over Financial Table-Text Data via Semantic-Oriented Hierarchical Graphs": 0.11404180526733398, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_3>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587598": 0.11420762538909912, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_3>>abstract>>Towards the intelligent understanding of table-text data in the finance domain, previous research explores numerical reasoning over table-text content with Question Answering (QA) tasks. A general framework is to extract supporting evidence from the table and text and then perform numerical reasoning over extracted evidence for inferring the answer. However, existing models are vulnerable to missing supporting evidence, which limits their performance. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic-Oriented Hierarchical Graph (SoarGraph) that models the semantic relationships and dependencies among the different elements (e.g., question, table cells, text paragraphs, quantities, and dates) using hierarchical graphs to facilitate supporting evidence extraction and enhance numerical reasoning capability. We conduct our experiments on two popular benchmarks, FinQA and TAT-QA datasets, and the results show that our SoarGraph significantly outperforms all strong baselines, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness.": 0.12188196182250977, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_14>>title>>Hierarchy-Aware Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs": 0.1485876441001892}, "How do the authors aim to facilitate the work of AFC officers within the financial industry in their paper 'Exploiting graph metrics to detect anomalies in cross-country money transfer temporal networks'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_4>>title>>Exploiting graph metrics to detect anomalies in cross-country money transfer temporal networks": 0.07759296894073486, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_4>>abstract>>During the last decades, Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) entities and Financial Institutions have put a constantly increasing effort to reduce financial crime and detect fraudulent activities, that are changing and developing in extremely complex ways. We propose an anomaly detection approach based on network analysis to help AFC officers navigating through the high load of information that is typical of AFC data-driven scenarios. By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network metrics that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the metric-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system. This approach represents a preliminary step in the automation of AFC and AML processes, serving the purpose of facilitating the work of AFC officers by providing them with a top-down view of the picture emerging from financial data.": 0.08130699396133423, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: The Third Workshop on Financial Technology on the Web (FinWeb)_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587602": 0.12164837121963501}, "What are the 3 extraordinary examples of apps built for the Web, according to the author of 'The Capable Web'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Web Developer and W3C>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Web Developer and W3C_2>>abstract>>In this paper, I discuss arguments in favor and in disfavor of building for the Web.

As such, EA is a key tool for sustainability. Improving information access to EA reporting is a billion-euro untapped business opportunity to build an engaging, efficient digital experience for EA. We aim to become a landmark initiative in making this experience come true, by transforming the traditional manual assessment of numerous heterogeneous reports by experts into a computer-assisted approach. Specifically, a knowledge graph that represents and stores facts about EA practice allows for what it is so far only accessible manually to become machine-readable, and by this, to enable downstream information access services.

When two word pairs are similar in their relationships, we refer to their relations as analogous. Although the analogy method based on word embedding is well developed, the analogy reasoning is far beyond this scope. At present, the methods based on pre-trained language models have explored only the tip of the iceberg. In this paper, we proposed a multi-task learning method for analogical QA task. First, we obtain word-pair representations by leveraging the output embeddings of the [MASK] token in the pre-trained language model. The representations are prepared for two tasks. The first task aims to train an analogical classifier by supervised learning. The second task is an auxiliary task based on relation clustering to generate relation pseudo-labels for word pairs and train relation classifier. Our method guides the model to analyze the relation similarity in analogical reasoning without relation labels. The experiments show that our method achieve excellent performance on four analogical reasoning datasets without the help of external corpus and knowledge.

However, most existing visualization recommendation systems focus on ranking all possible visualizations based on the attributes or encodings, which makes it difficult to find the most relevant insights. We therefore introduce a novel class of insight-based visualization recommendation systems that automatically rank and recommend groups of related insights as well as the most important insights within each group. Our approach combines results from different learning-based methods to discover insights automatically and generalizes to a variety of attribute types (e.g., categorical, numerical, and temporal), including non-trivial combinations of these attribute types. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we implemented a insight-centric visualization recommendation system, SpotLight, and conducted a user study with twelve participants, which showed that users are able to quickly find and understand relevant insights in unfamiliar data.": 0.11243492364883423, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_5>>title>>SpotLight: Visual Insight Recommendation": 0.12360680103302002, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587302": 0.13847756385803223}, "What is the Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering that the project 'C-Affinity: A Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering' propose?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_10>>abstract>>Clustering is widely employed in various applications as it is one of the most useful data mining techniques. In performing clustering, a similarity measure, which defines how similar a pair of data objects are, plays an important role. A similarity measure is employed by considering a target dataset’s characteristics. Current similarity measures (or distances) do not reflect the distribution of data objects in a dataset at all. From the clustering point of view, this fact may limit the clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose c-affinity, a new notion of a similarity measure that reflects the distribution of objects in the given dataset from a clustering point of view. We design c-affinity between any two objects to have a higher value as they are more likely to belong to the same cluster by learning the data distribution. We use random walk with restart (RWR) on the k-nearest neighbor graph of the given dataset to measure (1) how similar a pair of objects are and (2) how densely other objects are distributed between them. Via extensive experiments on sixteen synthetic and real-world datasets, we verify that replacing the existing similarity measure with our c-affinity improves the clustering accuracy significantly.": 0.09746956825256348, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_10>>title>>C-Affinity: A Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering": 0.10224127769470215}, "What approach does the project 'Measuring Potential Performance Gains of Python Web Applications with pyUpgradeSim' use to measure the performance of OSS projects?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_40>>title>>Measuring Potential Performance Gains of Python Web Applications with pyUpgradeSim": 0.06824815273284912, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_40>>abstract>>Open-source software (OSS) plays a vital role in the modern software ecosystem.

Sensor and online crowd-sourced data combined with machine learning methods have provided a recent breakthrough in poverty map inference. However, these methods do not capture local wealth fluctuations, and are not optimized to produce accountable results that guarantee accurate predictions to all sub-populations. Here, we propose a pipeline of machine learning models to infer the mean and standard deviation of wealth across multiple geographically clustered populated places, and illustrate their performance in Sierra Leone and Uganda. These models leverage seven independent and freely available feature sources based on satellite images, and metadata collected via online crowd-sourcing and social media. Our models show that combined metadata features are the best predictors of wealth in rural areas, outperforming image-based models, which are the best for predicting the highest wealth quintiles. Our results recover the local mean and variation of wealth, and correctly capture the positive yet non-monotonous correlation between them. We further demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of model transfer across countries and the effects of data recency and other biases.

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines. Especially, our proposed KnowCL model can apply to both satellite and street imagery with both effectiveness and transferability achieved, which provides insights into urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction.": 0.12461847066879272, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_26>>title>>Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning for Urban Imagery-based Socioeconomic Prediction": 0.14605319499969482}, "What is the title of the contribution made by authors Apoorva Upadhyaya, Marco Fisichella, and Wolfgang Nejdl at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_3>>authors>>authors_3>>Wolfgang Nejdl": 0.09165412187576294, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_300>>authors>>authors_1>>Gustavo Penha": 0.11328434944152832, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_20>>authors>>authors_4>>Corrado Monti": 0.1172683835029602, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_26>>authors>>authors_4>>Jingping Liu": 0.117958664894104, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_364>>authors>>authors_4>>Shazia Sadiq and Gianluca Demartini": 0.11915731430053711, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_36>>authors>>authors_2>>Sachin Farfade and Prakash Mandayam Comar": 0.11964559555053711, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_338>>authors>>authors_5>>Ariel Zetlin-Jones and Nicolas Christin": 0.12042504549026489, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_30>>authors>>authors_2>>Dian Tang": 0.12114918231964111, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_269>>authors>>authors_2>>Gianmarco De Francisci Morales": 0.12125968933105469, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_133>>authors>>authors_5>>Junfan Chen": 0.12132459878921509, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_189>>authors>>authors_2>>Chuan Ma": 0.12142479419708252, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_169>>authors>>authors_4>>Di Niu and Haijiang Wu": 0.12164747714996338, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_3>>authors>>authors_2>>Marco Fisichella": 0.12192380428314209}, "How does the research 'ContrastFaux: Sparse Semi-supervised Fauxtography Detection on the Web using Multi-view Contrastive Learning' address the issue of online misinformation?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_8>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583869": 0.07526159286499023, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_8>>title>>ContrastFaux: Sparse Semi-supervised Fauxtography Detection on the Web using Multi-view Contrastive Learning": 0.07931816577911377, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_8>>abstract>>The widespread misinformation on the Web has raised many concerns with serious societal consequences. In this paper, we study a critical type of online misinformation, namely fauxtography, where the image and associated text of a social media post jointly convey a questionable or false sense. In particular, we focus on a sparse semi-supervised fauxtography detection problem, which aims to accurately identify fauxtography by only using the sparsely annotated ground truth labels of social media posts. Our problem is motivated by the key limitation of current fauxtography detection approaches that often require a large amount of expensive and inefficient manual annotations to train an effective fauxtography detection model. We identify two key technical challenges in solving the problem: 1) it is non-trivial to train an accurate detection model given the sparse fauxtography annotations, and 2) it is difficult to extract the heterogeneous and complicated fauxtography features from the multi-modal social media posts for accurate fauxtography detection. To address the above challenges, we propose ContrastFaux, a multi-view contrastive learning framework that jointly explores the sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multi-modal posts to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. Evaluation results on two social media datasets demonstrate that ContrastFaux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning fauxtography detection baselines by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy.": 0.0835726261138916}, "What dataset was used in the paper 'EDNet: Attention-Based Multimodal Representation for Classification of Twitter Users Related to Eating Disorders'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_16>>abstract>>Social media platforms provide rich data sources in several domains. In mental health, individuals experiencing an Eating Disorder (ED) are often hesitant to seek help through conventional healthcare services. However, many people seek help with diet and body image issues on social media. To better distinguish at-risk users who may need help for an ED from those who are simply commenting on ED in social environments, highly sophisticated approaches are required. Assessment of ED risks in such a situation can be done in various ways, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hence, there is a need for and potential benefit of a more complex multimodal approach. To this end, we collect historical tweets, user biographies, and online behaviours of relevant users from Twitter, and generate a reasonably large labelled benchmark dataset. Thereafter, we develop an advanced multimodal deep learning model called EDNet using these data to identify the different types of users with ED engagement (e.g., potential ED sufferers, healthcare professionals, or communicators) and distinguish them from those not experiencing EDs on Twitter. EDNet consists of five deep neural network layers. With the help of its embedding, representation and behaviour modeling layers, it effectively learns the multimodalities of social media. In our experiments, EDNet consistently outperforms all the baseline techniques by significant margins. It achieves an accuracy of up to 94.32% and F1 score of up to 93.91% F1 score.

Finding groups of nodes that form strongly stable agreements and participate in collective conflicts with other groups is an important problem in this context. Previous works approach this problem by finding balanced subgraphs, in which the polarity measure is optimized, that result in large subgraphs without a clear notion of agreement or conflict. In real-world signed networks, balanced subgraphs are often not polarized as in the case of a subgraph with only positive edges. To remedy this issue, we leverage the notion of cohesion — we find pairs of cohesively polarized communities where each node in a community is positively connected to nodes in the same community and negatively connected to nodes in the other community. To capture the cohesion along with the polarization, we define a new measure, dichotomy. We leverage the balanced triangles, which model the cohesion and polarization at the same time, to design a heuristic that results in good seedbeds for polarized communities in real-world signed networks. Then, we introduce the electron decomposition which finds cohesively polarized communities with high dichotomy score. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method finds cohesively polarized communities and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to several measures. Moreover, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing methods and practical for large-scale networks.": 0.12464356422424316}, "What insights did the research paper titled 'Towards Automated Detection of Risky Images Shared by Youth on Social Media' provide?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)_6>>abstract>>With the growing ubiquity of the Internet and access to media-based social media platforms, the risks associated with media content sharing on social media and the need for safety measures against such risks have grown paramount. At the same time, risk is highly contextualized, especially when it comes to media content youth share privately on social media. In this work, we conducted qualitative content analyses on risky media content flagged by youth participants and research assistants of similar ages to explore contextual dimensions of youth online risks. The contextual risk dimensions were then used to inform semi- and self-supervised state-of-the-art vision transformers to automate the process of identifying risky images shared by youth. We found that vision transformers are capable of learning complex image features for use in automated risk detection and classification.

Many modern e-commerce integrity systems utilize machine learning (ML) to detect fraud and bad actors. We discuss the practical problems faced by integrity systems which utilize data associated with user interactions with the platform. Specifically, we focus on the challenge of representing the user interaction events, and aggregating their features. We compare the performance of two paradigms to handle the feature temporality when training the ML models: hand-engineered temporal aggregation and a learned aggregation using a sequence encoder.

Specifically, we introduce a fresh cross-geometry aggregation which allows us to propagate information across different Riemannian manifolds without breaking conformal invariance, and a curvature estimator which is delicately designed to predict global curvatures effectively according to current local Ricci curvatures.

Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification.

Graphs have become a foundation for sharing data on the web and building intelligent services across many sectors and also within some of the most successful corporations in the world. The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers.

Finally, the last challenge is an open research question, since it revolves around the interoperability of privacy policies that belong to different systems and that are expressed with different privacy languages.": 0.1547887921333313, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_3>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587628": 0.16034245491027832}, "What solution is proposed in the paper 'A Decentralised Persistent Identification Layer for DCAT Datasets' to keep track of the datasets?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_2>>title>>A Decentralised Persistent Identification Layer for DCAT Datasets": 0.10740000009536743, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_2>>abstract>>The Data Catalogue Vocabulary (DCAT) standard is a popular RDF vocabulary for publishing metadata about data catalogs and a valuable foundation for creating Knowledge Graphs. It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). We implemented our approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric.": 0.10861122608184814, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_2>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587589": 0.12892675399780273}, "What is the proposed solution to privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics in the paper by Audrey Ekuban and John Domingue?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_5>>title>>Towards Decentralised Learning Analytics (Positioning Paper)": 0.11529016494750977, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_5>>abstract>>When students interact with an online course, the routes they take when navigating through the course can be captured. Learning Analytics is the process of measuring, collecting, recording, and analysing this Student Activity Data. Predictive Learning Analytics, a sub-field of Learning Analytics, can help to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or failing, as well as students who are close to a grade boundary. Course tutors can use the insights provided by the analyses to offer timely assistance to these students. Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.": 0.11590790748596191, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587644": 0.13605457544326782}, "What is the main goal of the 'Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track' at the 32nd edition of The Web Conference series?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>ConferenceURL>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.06656533479690552, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track name>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track": 0.06702768802642822, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Contributions>>To achieve this, we look for contributions that describe research results, tools, audits, frameworks, design techniques and experiments that are being developed to deal with fairness and equity, accountability, and transparency, broader social impact, and ethics on the Web.

This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of the metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above problems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving features designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for metaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to participate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational power, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only protects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high computing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many studies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some of the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with unlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse and FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse technologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the Internet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality. Finally, we discuss some key challenges and promising directions of FL4M in detail.

As personal computers grew in popularity, developers jumped at the opportunity to deploy cross-platform games with centralized management and a low barrier to entry. Simply going to the right address is now enough to start a game. From text-based to GPU-powered 3D games, browser gaming has evolved to become a strong alternative to traditional console and mobile-based gaming, targeting both casual and advanced gamers. Browser technology has also evolved to accommodate more demanding applications, sometimes even supplanting functions typically left to the operating system.

Because of this trend, community contribution-based, question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms became prominent for finding the proper solution to all programming issues. Stack Overflow has been the most popular platform for technical-related questions for years. Still, recently, some programming-related subreddits of Reddit have become a standing stone for questions and discussions. This work investigates the developers’ behavior and community formation around the twenty most popular programming languages. We examined two consecutive years of programming-related questions from Stack Overflow and Reddit, performing a longitudinal study on users’ posting activity and their high-order interaction patterns abstracted via hypergraphs. Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&A platforms are utilized by their users.

This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text. Our experimental results on the TLS-Covid19 test collection demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.": 0.11024302244186401, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web

Several studies have focused on understanding users’ reading behavior in desktop search. Their findings greatly contribute to the design of information retrieval models. However, little is known about how users read a result in mobile search, although search currently happens more frequently in mobile scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a lab-based user study to investigate users’ fine-grained reading behavior patterns in mobile search. We find that users’ reading attention allocation is strongly affected by several behavior biases, such as position and selection biases. Inspired by these findings, we propose a probabilistic generative model, the Passage-level Reading behavior Model (PRM), to model users’ reading behavior in mobile search. The PRM utilizes observable passage-level exposure and viewport duration events to infer users’ unobserved skimming event, reading event, and satisfaction perception during the reading process. Besides fitting the passage-level reading behavior, we utilize the fitted parameters of PRM to estimate the passage-level and document-level relevance.

We show that there exist sublinear query and time algorithms for testing three key properties of signed graphs: balance (or 2-clusterability), clusterability and signed triangle freeness. We consider both the dense graph model, where one queries the adjacency matrix entries of a signed graph, and the bounded-degree model, where one queries for the neighbors of a node and the sign of the connecting edge. Our algorithms use a variety of tools from unsigned graph property testing, as well as reductions from one setting to the other. Our main technical contribution is a sublinear algorithm for testing clusterability in the bounded-degree model. This contrasts with the property of k-clusterability in unsigned graphs, which is not testable with a sublinear number of queries in the bounded-degree model.

Most of the existing methods essentially optimize a Frobenius-like distance or ranking-based loss, ignoring the underlying geometry of graph data. Optimal transport (OT), together with Wasserstein distance, has emerged to be a powerful approach accounting for the underlying geometry explicitly. Promising as it might be, the state-of-the-art OT-based alignment methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) effectiveness due to the insufficient use of topology and consistency information and (2) scalability due to the non-convex formulation and repeated computationally costly loss calculation. In this paper, we propose a position-aware regularized optimal transport framework for network alignment named PARROT. To tackle the effectiveness issue, the proposed PARROT captures topology information by random walk with restart, with three carefully designed consistency regularization terms. To tackle the scalability issue, the regularized OT problem is decomposed into a series of convex subproblems and can be efficiently solved by the proposed constrained proximal point method with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves significant improvements in both effectiveness and scalability, outperforming the state-of-the-art network alignment methods and speeding up existing OT-based methods by up to 100 times.": 0.1307075023651123, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_39>>title>>GraphPrompt: Unifying Pre-Training and Downstream Tasks for Graph Neural Networks": 0.14286112785339355, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_35>>title>>PARROT: Position-Aware Regularized Optimal Transport for Network Alignment": 0.16198205947875977, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_35>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583357": 0.16803425550460815}, "What is the name of the paper that was written by Ke Zhang, Xiaoqing Wang, and Gong Cheng?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_238>>authors>>authors_5>>Qiaoyu Tan and Zhimeng Jiang": 0.11726301908493042, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_301>>authors>>authors_6>>Xiaohua Cheng and Zhao Cao": 0.11815106868743896, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_116>>authors>>authors_4>>Qiang Liu": 0.12137764692306519, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_145>>authors>>authors_5>>Huamin Feng and Yongdong Zhang": 0.12189042568206787, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_138>>authors>>authors_3>>Yingxue Zhang": 0.12252092361450195, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_48>>authors>>authors_4>>Qiang Fu": 0.12355613708496094, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_46>>authors>>authors_3>>Lu Sun": 0.12408030033111572, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_287>>authors>>authors_2>>Zhenzhe Zheng": 0.12461847066879272, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_79>>authors>>authors_6>>Pengwei Wang": 0.12463891506195068, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_104>>authors>>authors_4>>Zijian Zhang": 0.12525218725204468, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_193>>authors>>authors_3>>Peng Cheng": 0.12549161911010742, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_132>>authors>>authors_4>>Deqing Wang and Hongwei Zheng": 0.12550193071365356, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_128>>authors>>authors_4>>Qilong Han and Li Li": 0.1261371374130249, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_38>>authors>>authors_1>>Yuchen Wang": 0.12625324726104736, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_301>>authors>>authors_4>>Zhicheng Dou": 0.12640070915222168, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_47>>authors>>authors_3>>Xiang Huang": 0.12643730640411377}, "Who are the track chairs for the 'Crowdsourcing and Human Computation Track' at the Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>In case you have doubts whether your paper fits the scope of this track, please contact the track chairs>>hcomp-webconf2023@easychair.org": 0.08401387929916382, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_1>>affiliation>>Delft University of Technology": 0.08457815647125244, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Contact>>hcomp-webconf2023@easychair.org": 0.09208476543426514, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>we invite work addressing contemporary HCOMP challenges including (but not limited to) the following Web-related themes>>Underlying workforce powering Web-based HCOMP>>Social and economic impacts of human computation and crowdsourcing>>societal and methodological challenges around crowdsourcing labor and workforces;

This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations.

Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

Notably, it is challenging and critical to consider both the developers’ interests and the semantic features of the project code to recommend appropriate development tasks to OSS developers. In this paper, we formulate the novel problem of code recommendation, whose purpose is to predict the future contribution behaviors of developers given their interaction history, the semantic features of source code, and the hierarchical file structures of projects. We introduce CODER, a novel graph-based CODE Recommendation framework for open source software developers, which accounts for the complex interactions among multiple parties within the system. CODER jointly models microscopic user-code interactions and macroscopic user-project interactions via a heterogeneous graph and further bridges the two levels of information through aggregation on file-structure graphs that reflect the project hierarchy. Moreover, to overcome the lack of reliable benchmarks, we construct three large-scale datasets to facilitate future research in this direction.

However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent capability of improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations.

However, the interaction signal may not be sufficient to accurately characterize user interests and the low-pass filters may ignore the useful information contained in the high-frequency component of the observed signals, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To this end, we propose a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design the personalized graph signal containing richer user information and construct an augmented similarity graph containing more graph topology information, to more effectively characterize user interests. Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful information in the high-frequency components of the observed signals by combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the personalized graph signal, the augmented similarity graph and the mixed-frequency graph filter by proposing a pipeline consisting of three key steps: pre-processing, graph convolution and post-processing. Extensive experiments show that PGSP can achieve superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art CF methods and, as a nonparametric method, PGSP has very high training efficiency.": 0.09908753633499146, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_52>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583495": 0.10480916500091553}, "What is the proposed solution by the authors of the paper 'Confident Action Decision via Hierarchical Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation' in regards to reading large tables on small mobile screens?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_60>>abstract>>Reading large tables on small mobile screens presents serious usability challenges that can be addressed, in part, by better table formatting. However, there are few evidenced-based guidelines for formatting mobile tables to improve readability. For this work, we first conducted a survey to investigate how people interact with tables on mobile devices and conducted a study with designers to identify which design considerations are most critical.

Across the studies, we analyze over 14,000 trials from 590 participants who each viewed and answered questions about 28 diverse tables rendered in different formats.

It motivates us to leverage the embedding normalization in recommendation. By normalizing user/item embeddings to a specific value, we empirically observe impressive performance gains (9% on average) on four real-world datasets.

We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices.

However, the use of such algorithms comes with trade-offs in terms of algorithmic fairness, which has been widely acknowledged. Specifically, we have empirically observed that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn, causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive users. To address the above issues, we propose DP-Fair, a two-stage framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations. The experimental results, based on Amazon datasets, and user history logs collected from Etsy, one of the largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of both overall accuracy and user group fairness on both shallow and deep recommendation models compared to vanilla DP-SGD.": 0.12465935945510864, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems_2>>title>>Interleaved Online Testing in Large-Scale Systems": 0.12577080726623535, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_24>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583341": 0.1323302984237671}, "What is the topic discussed in the work 'Toward Open-domain Slot Filling via Self-supervised Co-training' by Adib Mosharrof, Moghis Fereidouni, and A.B.

The end-to-end models have achieved satisfactory performance in summarization, but the success is built upon enough annotated data, which is costly to obtain, especially in the dialogue summarization. To leverage the rich external data, previous works first pre-train the model on the other domain data (e.g., the news domain), and then fine-tune it directly on the dialogue domain. The data from different domains are equally treated during the training process, while the vast differences between dialogues (usually informal, repetitive, and with multiple speakers) and conventional articles (usually formal and concise) are neglected. In this work, we propose to use a disentangled representation method to reduce the deviation between data in different domains, where the input data is disentangled into domain-invariant and domain-specific representations. The domain-invariant representation carries context information that is supposed to be the same across domains (e.g., news, dialogue) and the domain-specific representation indicates the input data belongs to a particular domain. We use adversarial learning and contrastive learning to constrain the disentangled representations to the target space. Furthermore, we propose two novel reconstruction strategies, namely backtracked and cross-track reconstructions, which aim to reduce the domain characteristics of out-of-domain data and mitigate the domain bias of the model. Experimental results on three public datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the strong baselines.": 0.15761452913284302, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_51>>title>>Toward Open-domain Slot Filling via Self-supervised Co-training": 0.15987318754196167}, "What challenge does the work 'Active Learning from the Web' by Ryoma Sato aim to address?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_21>>title>>Active Learning from the Web": 0.1361716389656067, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_21>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583346": 0.14292246103286743, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_21>>title>>Active Learning from the Web": 0.14578479528427124, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_1>>Accessible e-learning, student evaluation and assessment": 0.14771050214767456, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_7>>Social interaction": 0.1487371325492859, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>web-related challenges>>web-related challenges_5>>Enhancements for accessible communication (e.g. accessible information and communication technologies – including social media, learning technologies, authoring technologies, multilingualism)": 0.15123742818832397}, "What is the goal of the work 'Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal representation learning for NFT selling price prediction' by Davide Costa, Lucio La Cava, and Andrea Tagarelli?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_46>>title>>Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal representation learning for NFT selling price prediction": 0.10117954015731812, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_178>>title>>Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal representation learning for NFT selling price prediction": 0.1093711256980896, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_46>>title>>Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal representation learning for NFT selling price prediction": 0.12963545322418213, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_46>>abstract>>The goal of relation extraction (RE) is to extract the semantic relations between/among entities in the text.

Given a user query, the retrieval phase returns a subset of candidate products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image).

For cloud-native applications, multiple containers collaborate to handle user requests, making each container’s workload changes influenced by workload group behavior. However, existing approaches mainly analyze the individual changes of each container and do not explicitly model the workload group evolution of containers, resulting in sub-optimal results. Therefore, we propose a workload prediction method, GROUP, which implements the shifts of workload prediction focus from individual to group, workload group behavior representation from data similarity to data correlation, and workload group behavior evolution from implicit modeling to explicit modeling. First, we model the workload group behavior and its evolution from multiple perspectives. Second, we propose a container correlation calculation algorithm that considers static and dynamic container information to represent the workload group behavior. Third, we propose an end-to-end multi-step-ahead prediction method that explicitly portrays the complex relationship between the evolution of workload group behavior and the workload changes of each container.

For each user request, a few of the microservices are called, and a trace is formed to record the tree-like call dependencies among microservices and the time consumption at each call node. Traces are useful in diagnosing system failures, but their complex structures make it difficult to model their patterns and detect their anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-variable graph variational autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection on microservice traces. To reconstruct the time consumption of nodes, we propose a novel dispatching layer. We find that the inversion of negative log-likelihood (NLL) appears for some anomalous samples, which makes the anomaly score infeasible for anomaly detection. To address this, we point out that the NLL can be decomposed into KL-divergence and data entropy, whereas lower-dimensional anomalies can introduce an entropy gap with normal inputs. We propose three techniques to mitigate this entropy gap for trace anomaly detection: Bernoulli & Categorical Scaling, Node Count Normalization, and Gaussian Std-Limit.

To overcome these drawbacks, we propose FedEdge, a novel edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme that accelerates model training with asynchronous local federated training and adaptive model aggregation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used public datasets.

It allows the cloud service provider to sell more resources than the physical limit, assuming not all users would fully utilize the resources simultaneously. However, how to design an oversubscription policy that improves utilization while satisfying some safety constraints remains an open problem. Existing methods and industrial practices are over-conservative, ignoring the coordination of diverse resource usage patterns and probabilistic constraints. To address these two limitations, this paper formulates the oversubscription for cloud as a chance-constrained optimization problem and proposes an effective Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (C2MARL) method to solve this problem. Specifically, C2MARL reduces the number of constraints by considering their upper bounds and leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm to learn a safe and optimal coordination policy. We evaluate our C2MARL on an internal cloud platform and public cloud datasets. Experiments show that our C2MARL outperforms existing methods in improving utilization () under different levels of safety constraints.": 0.12730473279953003, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_8>>title>>CMDiagnostor: An Ambiguity-Aware Root Cause Localization Approach Based on Call Metric Data": 0.14993691444396973, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_6>>title>>RL-MPCA: A Reinforcement Learning Based Multi-Phase Computation Allocation Approach for Recommender Systems": 0.15577757358551025}, "What is the focus of the paper 'Visual-Aware Testing and Debugging for Web Performance Optimization'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_9>>title>>Visual-Aware Testing and Debugging for Web Performance Optimization": 0.0970192551612854, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_278>>title>>Visual-Aware Testing and Debugging for Web Performance Optimization": 0.09843224287033081, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_9>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583323": 0.10800689458847046, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_9>>title>>Visual-Aware Testing and Debugging for Web Performance Optimization": 0.13749659061431885, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_10>>abstract>>Web performance optimization services, or web performance optimizers (WPOs), play a critical role in today’s web ecosystem by improving page load speed and saving network traffic.

Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.": 0.11250531673431396}, "What was the focus of the 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_1>>abstract>>Deep learning and the Web of Things (WoT) have become powerful tools for web engineering, leading to increased investigation and publication of research related to deep learning in web engineering.

Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM) is the task of finding useful patterns that statistically occur more often from databases for one class than for another. The existing SSPM task does not consider the weight of each item. While in the real world, the significant level of different items/objects is various. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Weighted Statistically Significant Patterns Mining (WSSPM) problem and propose a novel WSSpm algorithm to successfully solve it. We present a new framework that effectively mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. We also propose a new weighted support threshold that can satisfy the demand of WSSPM and prove its correctness and completeness. Besides, our weighted support threshold and modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range. Finally, experimental results on several real datasets show that the WSSpm algorithm performs well in terms of execution time and memory storage.": 0.10950362682342529}, "What is the purpose of DSNet in video salient object detection for IoT and WoT applications?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_5>>title>>DSNet: Efficient Lightweight Model for Video Salient Object Detection for IoT and WoT Applications": 0.08145827054977417, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587592": 0.10632359981536865, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_5>>abstract>>The most challenging aspects of deploying deep models in IoT and embedded systems are extensive computational complexity and large training and inference time. Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect). The extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of computational complexity, number of parameters, and latency measures.": 0.10752606391906738}, "What is the importance of a human-centric approach in the concept of a Metaverse?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_6>>abstract>>In the era of the Web of Things, the Metaverse is expected to be the landing site for the next generation of the Internet, resulting in the increased popularity of related technologies and applications in recent years and gradually becoming the focus of Internet research.

To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook.

setting to overcome the cold start problem and we propose a constrained clarifying question generation system which uses both question templates and query facets to guide the effective and precise

Its main objectives are to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. For this, research published at TempWeb covers (and has covered in its previous editions) the full spectrum of longitudinal studies using web content. This ranges from “low-level” network analysis (e.g., Internet traffic) and graph analysis (e.g., in social media) up to “high-level” content and concept analysis ranging from micro-content (e.g., tweets) up to entire web archives. As such, TempWeb has become a potential object of longitudinal studies on its own. Aiming at the investigation of infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Web scale, TempWeb has developed as a forum for a community from science and industry. Since longitudinal aspects in web content analysis is becoming more and more relevant for analysts from various domains, the studies, tools, and demonstrations are not only relevant for computer science, but also potentially interesting for sociology, marketing, environmental studies, politics, etc. Keeping up with its “tradition”, the current edition covers again the full spectrum of temporal Web analytics at various levels of granularity.": 0.08486807346343994, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)_1>>title>>13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb) Overview": 0.08502823114395142}, "What is the website for the 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_20>>website>>https://flw.di.unito.it/": 0.08025777339935303, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_1>>title>>1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies": 0.08742004632949829, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587681": 0.09376126527786255, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_2>>authors>>authors_3>>Wensheng Gan": 0.0966610312461853, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_4>>abstract>>The goal of this workshop is to focus the attention of the TheWebConf research community on addressing the open questions and challenges in this thriving research area.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the situations that arouse out of the pandemic were so incongruous to the world we knew that even factual statements often had a humorous reaction. In this paper, we present a dataset of 2510 samples hand-annotated with labels such as humor style, type, theme, target and stereotypes formed or exploited while creating the humor in addition to 909 memes. Our dataset comprises Reddit posts, comments, Onion news headlines, real news headlines, and tweets. We evaluate the task of humor detection and maladaptive humor detection on state-of-the-art models namely RoBERTa and GPT-3. The finetuned models trained on our dataset show significant gains over zero-shot models including GPT-3 when detecting humor. Even though GPT-3 is good at generating meaningful explanations, we observed that it fails to detect maladaptive humor due to the absence of overt targets and profanities. We believe that the presented dataset will be helpful in designing computational methods for topical humor processing as it provides a unique sample set to study the theory of incongruity in a post-pandemic world.

The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. In this work, we conduct a case study approaching this problem with semi-supervised learning using a large language model (LLM). We select Reddit as the target social media platform due to its broad coverage of topics and content types. Our pipeline first generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while training the student model using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.": 0.0983666181564331, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_4>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587605": 0.1295880675315857, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_26>>title>>What do LLMs Know about Financial Markets?

One such structure, the Ego Network Model (ENM), has been found almost ubiquitously in human society. Recently, this model has been extended to include signed connections. While the unsigned ENM has been rigorously observed for decades, the signed version is still somewhat novel and lacks the same breadth of observation. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to examine this signed structure across various categories of individuals from a swathe of culturally distinct regions. Minor differences in the distribution of signs across the SENM can be observed between cultures. However, these can be overwhelmed when the network is centred around a specific topic. Indeed, users who are engaged with specific themes display higher levels of negativity in their networks. This effect is further supported by a significant negative correlation between the number of \"general\" topics discussed in a network and that network’s percentage of negative connections. These findings suggest that the negativity of communications and relationships on Twitter are very dependent on the topics being discussed and, furthermore, these relationships are more likely to be negative when they are based around a specific topic.": 0.09121334552764893, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_7>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587641": 0.11234498023986816}, "What does the paper 'Claim Extraction and Dynamic Stance Detection in COVID-19 Tweets' propose to do?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_9>>title>>Claim Extraction and Dynamic Stance Detection in COVID-19 Tweets": 0.09836322069168091, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_9>>abstract>>The information ecosystem today is noisy, and rife with messages that contain a mix of objective claims and subjective remarks or reactions.

In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.": 0.1068691611289978}, "Where will both the WebConf2023 and WebSci'23 take place?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>description>>description_1>>WebSci’23 – 15th ACM Web Science Conference": 0.10306739807128906, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>description>>description_3>>Austin, Texas, USA (co-located with The Web Conference)": 0.10480719804763794, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>description>>description_2>>April 30 – May 1, 2023": 0.10904842615127563, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>desciption>>This year, ACM WebSci’23 is co-located with The Web Conference.

To ensure consistent model performance and account for variations in data distribution, regular retraining is necessary. This paper introduces a solution for improving online customer service in e-commerce by presenting a universal model for predicting labels based on customer questions, without requiring training. Our novel approach involves using machine learning techniques to tag customer questions in transcripts and create a repository of questions and corresponding labels. When a customer requests assistance, an information retrieval model searches the repository for similar questions, and statistical analysis is used to predict the corresponding label. By eliminating the need for individual model training and maintenance, our approach reduces both the model development cycle and costs. The repository only requires periodic updating to maintain accuracy.": 0.16338932514190674}, "What are the problems faced by commercial search engines as mentioned in 'Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Neural Query Rewriting'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)_10>>abstract>>The main task of an e-commerce search engine is to semantically match the user query to the product inventory and retrieve the most relevant items that match the user’s intent. This task is not trivial as often there can be a mismatch between the user’s intent and the product inventory for various reasons, the most prevalent being: (i) the buyers and sellers use different vocabularies, which leads to a mismatch; (ii) the inventory doesn’t contain products that match the user’s intent. To build a successful e-commerce platform it is of paramount importance to be able to address both of these challenges. To do so, query rewriting approaches are used, which try to bridge the semantic gap between the user’s intent and the available product inventory. Such approaches use a combination of query token dropping, replacement and expansion. In this work we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-enhanced neural query rewriting in the e-commerce domain. We use a relationship-rich product Knowledge Graph to infuse auxiliary knowledge in a transformer-based query rewriting deep neural network. Experiments on two tasks, query pruning and complete query rewriting, show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline BERT-based query rewriting solution.": 0.1300104856491089, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)_10>>title>>Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Neural Query Rewriting": 0.1321740746498108, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)_10>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587678": 0.1401761770248413}, "Why is there a need to improve Season-Aware Query-Product Semantic Similarity in product search for online shopping?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)_4>>title>>Improving Product Search with Season-Aware Query-Product Semantic Similarity": 0.10128456354141235, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd Workshop on Interactive and Scalable Information Retrieval Methods for eCommerce (ISIR-eCom)_4>>abstract>>Commercial search engines use different semantic models to augment lexical matches. These models provide candidate items for a user’s query from a target space of millions to billions of items. Models with different inductive biases provide relatively different predictions, making it desirable to launch multiple semantic models in production. However, latency and resource constraints make simultaneously deploying multiple models impractical. In this paper, we introduce a distillation approach, called Blend and Match (BM), to unify two different semantic search models into a single model. We use a Bi-encoder semantic matching model as our primary model and propose a novel loss function to incorporate eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) predictions as the secondary model. Our experiments conducted on two large-scale datasets, collected from a popular e-commerce store, show that our proposed approach significantly improves the recall of the primary Bi-encoder model by 11% to 17% with a minimal loss in precision. We show that traditional knowledge distillation approaches result in a sub-optimal performance for our problem setting, and our BM approach yields comparable rankings with strong Rank Fusion (RF) methods used only if one could deploy multiple models.": 0.1154443621635437}, "What are the key objectives in designing payment mechanisms in crowdsourcing contexts according to the research presented at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_7>>abstract>>We consider the crowdsourcing setting where, in response to the assigned tasks, agents strategically decide both how much effort to exert (from a continuum) and whether to manipulate their reports.

Many modern e-commerce integrity systems utilize machine learning (ML) to detect fraud and bad actors. We discuss the practical problems faced by integrity systems which utilize data associated with user interactions with the platform. Specifically, we focus on the challenge of representing the user interaction events, and aggregating their features. We compare the performance of two paradigms to handle the feature temporality when training the ML models: hand-engineered temporal aggregation and a learned aggregation using a sequence encoder.

Such tracking methods usually include first and third-party cookies, cookie synchronization, as well as a variety of fingerprinting mechanisms. Facebook (FB) (now Meta) recently introduced a new tagging mechanism that attaches a one-time tag as a URL parameter (namely FBCLID) on outgoing links to other websites. Although such a tag does not seem to have enough information to persistently track users, we demonstrate that despite its ephemeral nature, when combined with FB Pixel, it can aid in persistently monitoring user browsing behavior across i) different websites, ii) different actions on each website, iii) time, i.e., both in the past as well as in the future.

However, existing detection methods in the audio area exclusively work in English, and there is a lack of data resources in other languages. Cross-lingual deepfake detection, a critical but rarely explored area, urges more study. This paper conducts the first comprehensive study on the cross-lingual perspective of deepfake detection. We observe that English data enriched in deepfake algorithms can teach a detector the knowledge of various spoofing artifacts, contributing to performing detection across language domains. Based on the observation, we first construct a first-of-its-kind cross-lingual evaluation dataset including heterogeneous spoofed speech uttered in the two most widely spoken languages, then explored domain adaptation (DA) techniques to transfer the artifacts detection capability and propose effective and practical DA strategies fitting the cross-lingual scenario. Our adversarial-based DA paradigm teaches the model to learn real/fake knowledge while losing language dependency.

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.": 0.1309792399406433}, "Who are the authors of the paper titled 'Robust Recommendation with Adversarial Gaussian Data Augmentation'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_84>>title>>Robust Recommendation with Adversarial Gaussian Data Augmentation": 0.09951341152191162, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_13>>title>>Robust Recommendation with Adversarial Gaussian Data Augmentation": 0.10792362689971924, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_13>>abstract>>Recommender system holds the promise of accurately understanding and estimating the user preferences. However, due to the extremely sparse user-item interactions, the learned recommender models can be less robust and sensitive to the highly dynamic user preferences and easily changed recommendation environments. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective robust recommender framework by generating additional samples from the Gaussian distributions. In specific, we design two types of data augmentation strategies. For the first one, we directly produce the data based on the original samples, where we simulate the generation process in the latent space. For the second one, we firstly change the original samples towards the direction of maximizing the loss function, and then produce the data based on the altered samples to make more effective explorations. Based on both of the above strategies, we leverage adversarial training to optimize the recommender model with the generated data which can achieve the largest losses. In addition, we theoretically analyze our framework, and find that the above two data augmentation strategies equal to impose a gradient based regularization on the original recommender models. We conduct extensive experiments based on six real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.": 0.11220169067382812, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference

The most common assumption is that the online requests have randomly generated i.i.d. types. This assumption is well justified for static markets and/or relatively short time periods. We consider dynamic markets, whose states evolve as a random walk in a market-specific Markov Chain. This is a new model that generalizes previous i.i.d. settings. We identify important parameters of the Markov chain that is crucial for obtaining good approximation guarantees to the expected value of the optimal offline algorithm which knows realizations of all requests in advance. We focus on a stylized single-resource setting and: (i) generalize the well-known Prophet Inequality from the optimal stopping theory (single-unit setting) to Markov Chain setting; (ii) in multi-unit setting, design a simple algorithm that is asymptotically optimal under mild assumptions on the underlying Markov chain.": 0.1356898546218872, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research

Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_36>>abstract>>Web-based online interactive visual analytics enjoys popularity in recent years. Traditionally, visualizations are produced directly from querying the underlying data. However, for a very large dataset, this way is so time-consuming that it cannot meet the low-latency requirements of interactive visual analytics. In this paper, we propose a learning-based visualization approach called BlinkViz, which uses a learned model to produce approximate visualizations by leveraging mixed sum-product networks to learn the distribution of the original data. In such a way, it makes visualization faster and more scalable by decoupling visualization and data. In addition, to improve the accuracy of approximate visualizations, we propose an enhanced model by incorporating a neural network with residual structures, which can refine prediction results, especially for visual requests with low selectivity. Extensive experiments show that BlinkViz is extremely fast even on a large dataset with hundreds of millions of data records (over 30GB), responding in sub-seconds (from 2ms to less than 500ms for different requests) while keeping a low error rate. Furthermore, our approach remains scalable on latency and memory footprint size regardless of data size.": 0.12093967199325562}, "What is the paper 'Know Your Transactions: Real-time and Generic

impact in online retailing. The proposed method specifies a statistical design, a sampling algorithm, and a technological setup for data collection through web crawling. The statistical design reduces the dimensionality of the problem and ensures that the data collected are representative, variation-rich, and suitable for the investigation of the causes behind any observed disparities. Implementations of the method can collect data on algorithmic decisions, such as price, recommendations, and delivery fees that can be matched to website visitor demographic data from established sources such as censuses and large scale surveys. The combined data can be used to investigate the presence and causes of disparate impact, potentially helping online retailers audit their algorithms without collecting or holding the demographic data of their users. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of the automated pricing decisions of a leading retailer in the United States. A custom-built platform implemented the method to collect data for nearly 20,000 different grocery products at more than 3,000 randomly-selected zip codes. The data collected indicates that prices are higher for locations with high proportions of minority households.

Collaborative Filtering (ECF) model that leverages interpretable cluster learning to achieve the two most demanding objectives: (1) Precise - the model should not compromise accuracy in the pursuit of explainability; and (2) Self-explainable - the model’s explanations should truly reflect its decision-making process, not generated from post-hoc methods. The core of ECF is mining taste clusters from user-item interactions and item profiles. We map each user and item to a sparse set of taste clusters, and taste clusters are distinguished by a few representative tags. The user-item preference, users/items’ cluster affiliations, and the generation of taste clusters are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we introduce a forest mechanism to ensure the model’s accuracy, explainability, and diversity. To comprehensively evaluate the explainability quality of taste clusters, we design several quantitative metrics, including in-cluster item coverage, tag utilization, silhouette, and informativeness. Our model’s effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets.": 0.1387782096862793, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_9>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583303": 0.14754414558410645}, "Who is delivering the Turing Award Lecture at the ACM Web Conference and which event is held in his honor?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_1>>title>>ACM Turing Award Lecture Bob Metcalfe": 0.10135310888290405, "WWW2023>>Program>>ACM A.M.

According to the explorer, we find that more than 75% of slashable Byzantine actions were not slashed. Since Ethereum relies on the “stake-and-slash\" mechanism to align incentives, this finding would at its face value cause concern over Ethereum’s security. However, further investigation reveals that all the apparent unslashed incidents were erroneously recorded due to the explorer’s mishandling of consensus edge cases.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving.

In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively.

Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.": 0.1037759780883789}, "What is the title of the paper presented at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call for Nominations for the Seoul Test of Time Award of The ACM Web Conference 2023>>awardYear>>2023": 0.10223734378814697, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_189>>authors>>authors_2>>Chuan Ma": 0.10238027572631836, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_38>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587336": 0.1032983660697937, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call for Nominations for the Seoul Test of Time Award of The ACM Web Conference 2023>>conferenceName>>The ACM Web Conference 2023": 0.10342073440551758, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call for Nominations for the Seoul Test of Time Award of The ACM Web Conference 2023>>location>>Austin, Texas": 0.10366237163543701}, "Who are the authors of the research paper 'Tutorials at The Web Conference 2023'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_17>>organizers>>organizers_4>>Mehrnoosh Sameki": 0.11280739307403564, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>authors>>authors_16>>Torsten Hahmann": 0.11366987228393555, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>authors>>authors_48>>Behrooz Omidvar-Tehrani": 0.11414164304733276, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>title>>Tutorials at The Web Conference 2023": 0.1160382628440857, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>authors>>authors_90>>Xikun Zhang": 0.11617428064346313, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>authors>>authors_52>>Tiago Peixoto": 0.11628603935241699, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>authors>>authors_69>>Adaku Uchendu": 0.11638855934143066, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_24>>organizers>>organizers_4>>Josiah Poon": 0.11732274293899536, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_248>>authors>>authors_4>>Tianyu Cao": 0.11788874864578247, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_5>>authors>>authors_1>>Taro Tsuchiya": 0.11789923906326294, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>authors>>authors_94>>Liang Zhao": 0.11795884370803833}, "What is the content summary of the research paper 'Tutorials at The Web Conference 2023'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>title>>Tutorials at The Web Conference 2023": 0.08992254734039307, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>abstract>>This paper summarizes the content of the 28 tutorials that have been given at The Web Conference 2023.": 0.09479188919067383, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587713": 0.09885597229003906, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Tutorials>>Accepted Tutorials_17>>organizers>>organizers_4>>Mehrnoosh Sameki": 0.10196185111999512, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Tutorials Proposals>>Tutorial proposals should be structured as follows>>Style and Duration>>Please indicate whether this will be a lecture-style or hands-on tutorial.

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing. Finally, crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.": 0.10250478982925415, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Mon May 01>>Mon May 01_36>>event>>Keynote Presentation: David G.

This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web.": 0.11245858669281006, "WWW2023>>Program>>Program Overview>>Sunday April 30>>Sunday April 30_1>>url>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/program/workshops/": 0.11285877227783203, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>conference_details>>conference_website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.1135491132736206, "WWW2023>>Important Dates>>May 2023>>May 2023_1>>Event>>Conference Ends": 0.11489129066467285, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>sections>>sections_1>>content>>content_2>>10:00 am – 10:30 am: Opening Remarks": 0.11493134498596191, "WWW2023>>Home>>full name>>The Web Conference": 0.11619162559509277}, "What are the events at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center - Classroom #108 on Sun Apr 30?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_31>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Zlotnik Ballroom Foyer": 0.10795807838439941, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_1>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center: Zlotnik Ballroom Foyer": 0.11755484342575073, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_28>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #101": 0.11971491575241089, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_25>>track>>": 0.12183821201324463, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_2>>time>>7:30 AM – 9:00 AM": 0.12476730346679688, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_6>>track>>Tutorial": 0.1263766884803772, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Wed May 03>>Wed May 03_27>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Classroom #104": 0.12730801105499268, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_7>>event>>Tutorial: Towards Next-Generation Intelligent Assistants for AR/VR Devices": 0.1274336576461792, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Mon May 01>>Mon May 01_17>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center- Amphitheater 204": 0.1279262900352478, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_6>>event>>Tutorial: The Advantages of Adding Noise": 0.1284601092338562, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_4>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center -  Classroom #101": 0.1289311647415161, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Mon May 01>>Mon May 01_13>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center- Classroom #115": 0.12920856475830078, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_19>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Zlotnik Ballroom 5": 0.12951064109802246, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_11>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Zlotnik Ballroom Foyer": 0.13099241256713867}, "Who is the speaker for the Turing Lecture at the Web Conference?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_33>>speaker_affiliation>>CSAIL Research Affiliate in Computational Engineering Massachusetts Institute of Technology": 0.10149955749511719, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_33>>event>>Turing Lecture at the Web Conference Bob Metcalfe": 0.11055076122283936, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_33>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Zlotnik Ballroom 1-4": 0.11622589826583862, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_33>>speaker>>Bob Metcalfe": 0.12013465166091919, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_33>>time>>5:00 PM – 6:00 PM": 0.12148904800415039, "WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_1>>title>>ACM Turing Award Lecture Bob Metcalfe": 0.12310773134231567, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_33>>read more>>https://whova.com/embedded/session/m7eCHUp5UQyCXwXQUcx6AjbtsQvmmnL9TPylt16GSXQ%3D/2976463/?widget=primary": 0.1233903169631958, "WWW2023>>Program>>ACM A.M.

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively.

To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential.": 0.09290283918380737}, "What are the accepted papers under the 'Crowdsourcing and Human Computation' research track in WWW2023?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_6>>authors>>authors_1>>Tianjiao Yu": 0.06144547462463379, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_6>>authors>>authors_3>>Ismini Lourentzou and Kurt Luther": 0.06391239166259766, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>we invite work addressing contemporary HCOMP challenges including (but not limited to) the following Web-related themes>>Underlying workforce powering Web-based HCOMP>>Supporting HCOMP workers>>collective action; design activism; fair work(https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/); ghost work, heteromation, and invisible work; human computation, digital colonialism, and the global south; impact sourcing(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_sourcing) and responsible sourcing(https://partnershiponai.org/workstream/responsible-sourcing/); regulation; worker empowerment, organization, protection and wellness; and workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion, etc.": 0.07224869728088379, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Authors should consult the conference’s main Research Track CFP to ensure their submissions are aligned with broader conference expectations, scope, and theme>>Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility": 0.07676172256469727, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>we invite work addressing contemporary HCOMP challenges including (but not limited to) the following Web-related themes>>Web-based HCOMP systems, frameworks, or architectures>>Human computation>>decision-theoretic and game-theoretic design, design patterns, human algorithm design and complexity, mechanism and incentive design, etc.": 0.0776941180229187, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>we invite work addressing contemporary HCOMP challenges including (but not limited to) the following Web-related themes>>Underlying workforce powering Web-based HCOMP>>Social and economic impacts of human computation and crowdsourcing>>societal and methodological challenges around crowdsourcing labor and workforces; inequalities in access and representation in crowdsourcing workforces; platform affordances and economic impact": 0.07841473817825317}, "Who are the authors of the paper titled 'Combining Worker Factors for Heterogeneous Crowd Task Assignment'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_1>>title>>Combining Worker Factors for Heterogeneous Crowd Task Assignment": 0.07829570770263672, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_358>>title>>Combining Worker Factors for Heterogeneous Crowd Task Assignment": 0.09393709897994995, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_1>>abstract>>Optimising the assignment of tasks to workers is an effective approach to ensure high quality in crowdsourced data - particularly in heterogeneous micro tasks. However, previous attempts at heterogeneous micro task assignment based on worker characteristics are limited to using cognitive skills, despite literature emphasising that worker performance varies based on other parameters. This study is an initial step towards understanding whether and how multiple parameters such as cognitive skills, mood, personality, alertness, comprehension skill, and social and physical context of workers can be leveraged in tandem to improve worker performance estimations in heterogeneous micro tasks. Our predictive models indicate that these parameters have varying effects on worker performance in the five task types considered – sentiment analysis, classification, transcription, named entity recognition and bounding box. Moreover, we note 0.003 - 0.018 reduction in mean absolute error of predicted worker accuracy across all tasks, when task assignment is based on models that consider all parameters vs. models that only consider workers’ cognitive skills.

Simultaneously, these platforms enable professional investigators and amateur sleuths to collaboratively collect and identify imagery of suspects with the goal of holding them accountable for their actions. Through a case study of Sedition Hunters, a Twitter community whose goal is to identify individuals who participated in the 2021 U.S. Capitol Attack, we explore what are the main topics or targets of the community, who participates in the community, and how. Using topic modeling, we find that information sharing is the main focus of the community. We also note an increase in awareness of privacy concerns. Furthermore, using social network analysis, we show how some participants played important roles in the community. Finally, we discuss implications for the content and structure of online crowdsourced investigations.": 0.1512623429298401}, "Who is one of the authors who published a paper on 'Hidden Indicators of Collective Intelligence in Crowdfunding' under the 'Research Tracks' in WWW2023?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>title>>Hidden Indicators of Collective Intelligence in Crowdfunding": 0.07702040672302246, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_359>>title>>Hidden Indicators of Collective Intelligence in Crowdfunding": 0.07776802778244019, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>abstract>>Extensive literature argues that crowds possess essential collective intelligence benefits that allow superior decision-making by untrained individuals working in low-information environments. Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign. Our findings broaden the field of crowd-aware system design and inform discussions about the augmentation of traditional financing systems with tech innovations.": 0.10113030672073364, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>title>>Hidden Indicators of Collective Intelligence in Crowdfunding": 0.10603439807891846, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_6>>authors>>authors_3>>Ismini Lourentzou and Kurt Luther": 0.12267792224884033}, "What is the main emphasis of the Web Science Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>About the Web Science Conference>>Web Science is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding the complex and multiple impacts of the Web on society and vice versa.

When I say “suddenly” I refer to the Internet’s birthday, October 29, 1969 and how two thirds of the human race, five billion people, are already on the Internet, in only 50 years. Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it.

Due to the accelerating rate of research publication, together with the recognised benefits of interdisciplinary research, systems that facilitate researchers in discovering and understanding relevant works from beyond their immediate school of knowledge are vital. This work explores different methods of research paper representation (or document embedding), to identify those methods that are capable of preserving the interdisciplinary implications of research papers in their embeddings. In addition to evaluating state of the art methods of document embedding in a interdisciplinary citation prediction task, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network architecture designed to preserve the key interdisciplinary implications of research articles in citation network node embeddings.
