main focus of the Industry Track of The Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Industry Proposals>>description>>We invite contributions to the Industry Track to be held at The Web Conference 2023 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place online, hosted at Austin, USA, on April 30 - May 4, 2023.\nThe Web has proven to be a fertile ground for industrial research, and companies from small to large, from brand new to long established, are making an ongoing impact on the state of the art in science and engineering. The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library. Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference.
