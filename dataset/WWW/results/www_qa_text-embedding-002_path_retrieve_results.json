Traditional frame analysis requires a curated set of frames derived from manual content analysis by domain experts. In this work, we introduce a frame analysis approach based on pretrained Transformer models that let us capture frames in an exploratory manner beyond predefined frames. In our experiments on two public online news and social media datasets, we show that our approach lets us identify underexplored conceptualizations, such as that health-related content is framed in terms of beliefs for conspiracy media, while mainstream media is instead concerned with science. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for further research on exploratory computational framing analysis using pretrained Transformers.": 0.13894248008728027, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_10>>abstract>>Signed network graphs provide a way to model complex relationships and interdependencies between entities: negative edges allow for a deeper study of social dynamics. One approach to achieving balance in a network is to model the sources of conflict through structural balance. Current methods focus on computing the frustration index or finding the largest balanced clique, but these do not account for multiple ways to reach a consensus or scale well for large, sparse networks. In this paper, we propose an expansion of the frustration cloud computation and compare various tree-sampling algorithms that can discover a high number of diverse balanced states.

Following a short introduction motivating the reason why this issue has to be considered as pivotal both for the Web and for the society, the main problem raised by the research will be identified, namely, whether an action taken against a person, that in real-life would be a criminal conduct, is considerable as a crime in the Metaverse as well. A short assessment of the (very little so far) current state of the art, as well as the proposed approach and methodology will be then overviewed; finally, the contribution shows its current results, and concludes stating that countries are highly encouraged to shape respective criminal frameworks when applied to the Metaverse, and that the international community should consider the topic as a priority in its agenda.

While previous work has documented the importance of manual content moderation, the effects of automated content moderation remain largely unknown. Here, in a large study of Facebook comments (n = 412M), we used a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to measure the impact of automated content moderation on subsequent rule-breaking behavior (number of comments hidden/deleted) and engagement (number of additional comments posted). We found that comment deletion decreased subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments), even among other participants, suggesting that the intervention prevented conversations from derailing. Further, the effect of deletion on the affected user’s subsequent rule-breaking behavior was longer-lived than its effect on reducing commenting in general, suggesting that users were deterred from rule-breaking but not from commenting. In contrast, hiding (rather than deleting) content had small and statistically insignificant effects.

Asking clarifying questions in conversational search has been widely studied and considered an effective solution to resolve query ambiguity. Existing work have explored various approaches for clarifying question ranking and generation. However, due to the lack of real conversational search data, they have to use artificial datasets for training, which limits their generalizability to real-world search scenarios. As a result, the industry has shown reluctance to implement them in reality, further suspending the availability of real conversational search interaction data. The above dilemma can be formulated as a cold start problem of clarifying question generation and conversational search in general. Furthermore, even if we do have large-scale conversational logs, it is not realistic to gather training data that can comprehensively cover all possible queries and topics in open-domain search scenarios.

Graph-based methods for AKNNS in particular have received great attention due to their superior performance. These methods rely on greedy graph search to traverse the data points as embedding vectors in a database. Under this greedy search scheme, we make a key observation: many distance computations do not influence search updates so that these computations can be approximated without hurting performance. As a result, we propose FINGER, a fast inference method for efficient graph search in AKNNS. FINGER approximates the distance function by estimating angles between neighboring residual vectors. The approximated distance can be used to bypass unnecessary computations for faster searches. Empirically, when it comes to speeding up the inference of HNSW, which is one of the most popular graph-based AKNNS methods, FINGER significantly outperforms existing acceleration approaches and conventional libraries by 20 to 60 across different benchmark datasets.": 0.17942923307418823}, "What is the proposed solution in 'Zero-shot Clarifying Question Generation for Conversational Search'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_2>>authors>>authors_6>>Alastair Moore": 0.21159422397613525, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_2>>authors>>authors_5>>Jiangbo Shangguan": 0.2124781608581543, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_5>>authors>>authors_6>>Makarand Tapaswi": 0.2130259871482849, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_5>>authors>>authors_3>>Siri Venkata Pavan Kumar Kandru": 0.21304863691329956, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_2>>authors>>authors_3>>Yuen-Hsien Tseng": 0.21315479278564453, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_1>>authors>>authors_5>>Ryan Mcgranaghan": 0.21320480108261108, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_5>>authors>>authors_5>>Charu Sharma": 0.2133176326751709}, "What issue does the paper 'Learning Denoised and Interpretable Session Representation for Conversational Search' address?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_15>>abstract>>A long-standing challenge for search and conversational assistants is query intention detection in ambiguous queries.

the Web_5>>abstract>>This paper presents a method for assessing whether algorithmic decision making induces disparate impact in online retailing. The proposed method specifies a statistical design, a sampling algorithm, and a technological setup for data collection through web crawling. The statistical design reduces the dimensionality of the problem and ensures that the data collected are representative, variation-rich, and suitable for the investigation of the causes behind any observed disparities. Implementations of the method can collect data on algorithmic decisions, such as price, recommendations, and delivery fees that can be matched to website visitor demographic data from established sources such as censuses and large scale surveys. The combined data can be used to investigate the presence and causes of disparate impact, potentially helping online retailers audit their algorithms without collecting or holding the demographic data of their users. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of the automated pricing decisions of a leading retailer in the United States. A custom-built platform implemented the method to collect data for nearly 20,000 different grocery products at more than 3,000 randomly-selected zip codes. The data collected indicates that prices are higher for locations with high proportions of minority households. Although these price disparities can be partly attributed to algorithmic biases, they are mainly explained by local factors and therefore can be regarded as business necessities.": 0.2158592939376831}, "Which approach does Asara Senaratne propose for anomaly detection in Knowledge Graphs?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_57>>authors>>authors_4>>Qin Zhang": 0.21063953638076782, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_61>>authors>>authors_4>>Yongduo Sui": 0.2115333080291748, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_59>>authors>>authors_4>>Lingjuan Lyu": 0.21223652362823486, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_57>>authors>>authors_3>>Chunyang Chen": 0.21233046054840088, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_17>>authors>>authors_4>>Xiaoran Yan": 0.21235227584838867, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_70>>authors>>authors_17>>Hongxia Yang and Jie Tang": 0.21257132291793823, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_47>>authors>>authors_4>>Renyu Yang": 0.21268302202224731, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_41>>authors>>authors_4>>Jingwei Liang": 0.2128448486328125, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_21>>authors>>authors_4>>Jia Wu": 0.2128954529762268, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_71>>authors>>authors_4>>Yuandong Wang": 0.21307164430618286, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_61>>authors>>authors_3>>Yuchun Qian": 0.2131165862083435, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_55>>authors>>authors_3>>Huan Zhao and Quanming Yao": 0.21316593885421753}, "What are the roles of Liane Lewin-Eytan, Suzan Verberne, and Michael Bendersky in The Web Conference (WWW2023) Search Track?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_17>>authors>>authors_3>>Kai Yang": 0.16435766220092773, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_20>>authors>>authors_3>>Yelena Mejova": 0.16436094045639038, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_7>>authors>>authors_3>>Qi Liu": 0.16443723440170288, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_12>>authors>>authors_3>>Evangelos P.

These models learn to predict the next items a user is likely to interact with based on his/her interaction history on the platform. Most sequential recommenders however lack a higher-level understanding of user intents, which often drive user behaviors online. Intent modeling is thus critical for understanding users and optimizing long-term user experience. We propose a probabilistic modeling approach and formulate user intent as latent variables, which are inferred based on user behavior signals using variational autoencoders (VAE). The recommendation policy is then adjusted accordingly given the inferred user intent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the latent user intent modeling via offline analyses as well as live experiments on a large-scale industrial recommendation platform.": 0.12644577026367188, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_20>>abstract>>Query intent classification, which aims at assisting customers to find desired products, has become an essential component of the e-commerce search.

In our experiments on two public online news and social media datasets, we show that our approach lets us identify underexplored conceptualizations, such as that health-related content is framed in terms of beliefs for conspiracy media, while mainstream media is instead concerned with science.

This work discusses the likely generalized architecture of patient-specific digital twins and digital twin networks, as well as the benefits, existing barriers, and potential gateways to the application of digital twin technology in radiation oncology.": 0.20243984460830688, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: International Workshop on Digital Twins for Smart Health>>SESSION: Workshop: International Workshop on Digital Twins for Smart Health_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3589752": 0.21088874340057373, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: International Workshop on Digital Twins for Smart Health>>SESSION: Workshop: International Workshop on Digital Twins for Smart Health_1>>title>>International Workshop on Digital Twins for Smart Health": 0.21184015274047852}, "Who are the authors of this research document?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_19>>authors>>authors_6>>Hao Wang and Enhong Chen": 0.1675153374671936, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_4>>authors>>authors_6>>Xiaohua Cheng and Zhao Cao": 0.1681056022644043, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_14>>authors>>authors_6>>Anlei Dong": 0.168598473072052, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_5>>authors>>authors_6>>Binxing Jiao and Daxin Jiang": 0.16884392499923706, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_24>>authors>>authors_6>>Swapnil  Raz": 0.16886568069458008, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_1>>authors>>authors_3>>Yifei Zhang and Irwin King": 0.16919809579849243, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_16>>authors>>authors_6>>Xian-Sheng Hua and Xiao Luo": 0.16955655813217163, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_6>>authors>>authors_3>>Guoliang Yang": 0.1708146333694458, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_8>>authors>>authors_3>>Kedi Xu": 0.17151421308517456, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_6>>authors>>authors_5>>Qianlong Xie": 0.17169040441513062, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_8>>authors>>authors_1>>Zhijing Wu": 0.17217093706130981, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_6>>authors>>authors_1>>Jiahong Zhou": 0.17218172550201416, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_16>>authors>>authors_3>>Xiang Wei": 0.17236024141311646, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_6>>authors>>authors_6>>Lebin Lin": 0.1724284291267395, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Search>>Search_12>>authors>>authors_3>>Ryen W.

DAWs are feature-rich software and therefore particularly complex to develop in terms of design, implementation, performances and ergonomics. Very few commercial online DAWs exist today and the only open-source examples lack features (no support for inter-operable plugins, for example) and do not take advantage of the recent possibilities offered by modern W3C APIs (e.g. AudioWorklets/Web Assembly). WAM Studio was developed as an open-source technology demonstrator with the aim of showcasing the potential of the web platform, made possible by these APIs.

Most global streaming services have introduced Machine Learning (ML) into their operations to personalize consumer experience, improve content, and further enhance the value proposition of streaming services. Despite the rapid growth, there is a need to bridge the gap between academic research and industry requirements and build connections between researchers and practitioners in the field.

We discover that the two methods behave very differently depending on the sparsity of the data set, where sparsity is defined by the amount of historical viewing data available to explain a movie recommendation for a particular data instance. We find that LIME does better than SHAP in dense segments of the data set and SHAP does better in sparse segments. We trace this difference to the differing bias-variance characteristics of the underlying estimators of LIME and SHAP. We find that SHAP exhibits lower variance in sparse segments of the data compared to LIME. We attribute this lower variance to the completeness constraint property inherent in SHAP and missing in LIME. This constraint acts as a regularizer and therefore increases the bias of the SHAP estimator but decreases its variance, leading to a favorable bias-variance trade-off especially in high sparsity data settings. With this insight, we introduce the same constraint into LIME and formulate a novel local explainabilty framework called Completeness-Constrained LIME (CLIME) that is superior to LIME and much faster than SHAP.": 0.22765100002288818, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender

Standard click propensity estimation techniques rely on simple models of user browsing behavior that primarily account for the attributes of the presentation context that affect whether the relevance of an item to the search context is observed. Most notably, the inherent effect of the listwise presentation of the items on users’ propensity for engagement is captured in the position of the presented items on the search result page. In this work, we enrich this position bias based click propensity model by proposing an observation model that further incorporates the underlying search intent, as reflected in the user’s click pattern in the search context. Our approach does not require an intent prediction model based on the content of the search context. Instead, we rely on a simple, yet effective, non-causal estimate of the user’s browsing intent from the number of click events in the search context. We empirically characterize the distinct rank decay patterns of the estimated click propensities in the characterized intent classes. In particular, we demonstrate a sharper decay of click propensities in top ranks for the intent class identified by sparse user clicks and the higher likelihood of observing clicks in lower ranks for the intent class identified by higher number of user clicks. We show that the proposed intent-aware propensity estimation technique helps with training ranking models with more effective personalization and generalization power through empirical results for a

We exploit the top-1K Twitter celebrities to identify the common interest among the followers of an influencer as his/her category. We annotate the top one thousand celebrities in multiple categories of popularity, language, and locations. Such categorization is essential for targeted marketing, recommending experts, etc. We define a novel FollowerSimilarity between the set of followers of an influencer and a celebrity. We propose an inverted index to calculate similarity values efficiently. We exploit the similarity score in a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and visualize the top celebrities over a neighborhood-embedded space.": 0.17114120721817017, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Beyond Facts: 3d International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse Analysis>>SESSION: Workshop: Beyond Facts: 3d International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Online Discourse Analysis_4>>abstract>>We present a novel algorithm for multilingual text clustering built upon two well studied techniques: multilingual aligned embedding and community detection in graphs.

While previous work has documented the importance of manual content moderation, the effects of automated content moderation remain largely unknown. Here, in a large study of Facebook comments (n = 412M), we used a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to measure the impact of automated content moderation on subsequent rule-breaking behavior (number of comments hidden/deleted) and engagement (number of additional comments posted). We found that comment deletion decreased subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments), even among other participants, suggesting that the intervention prevented conversations from derailing. Further, the effect of deletion on the affected user’s subsequent rule-breaking behavior was longer-lived than its effect on reducing commenting in general, suggesting that users were deterred from rule-breaking but not from commenting. In contrast, hiding (rather than deleting) content had small and statistically insignificant effects.

Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype.

To understand complex questions, existing studies employ language models (LMs) to encode contexts. Despite the simplicity, they neglect the latent relational information among question concepts and answers in KGs. While question concepts ubiquitously present hyponymy at the semantic level, e.g., mammals and animals, this feature is identically reflected in the hierarchical relations in KGs, e.g., a_type_of. Therefore, we are motivated to explore comprehensive reasoning by the hierarchical structures in KGs to help understand questions. However, it is non-trivial to reason over tree-like structures compared with chained paths. Moreover, identifying appropriate hierarchies relies on expertise. To this end, we propose HamQA, a novel Hierarchy-aware multi-hop Question Answering framework on knowledge graphs, to effectively align the mutual hierarchical information between question contexts and KGs. The entire learning is conducted in Hyperbolic space, inspired by its advantages of embedding hierarchical structures. Specifically, (i) we design a context-aware graph attentive network to capture context information. (ii) Hierarchical structures are continuously preserved in KGs by minimizing the Hyperbolic geodesic distances.

W3C_1>>abstract>>This paper presents WAM Studio, an open source, online Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that takes advantages of several W3C Web APIs, such as Web Audio, Web Assembly, Web Components, Web Midi, Media Devices etc. It also uses the Web Audio Modules proposal that has been designed to facilitate the development of inter-operable audio plugins (effects, virtual instruments, virtual piano keyboards as controllers etc.) and host applications. DAWs are feature-rich software and therefore particularly complex to develop in terms of design, implementation, performances and ergonomics. Very few commercial online DAWs exist today and the only open-source examples lack features (no support for inter-operable plugins, for example) and do not take advantage of the recent possibilities offered by modern W3C APIs (e.g. AudioWorklets/Web Assembly). WAM Studio was developed as an open-source technology demonstrator with the aim of showcasing the potential of the web platform, made possible by these APIs. The paper highlights some of the difficulties we encountered (i.e limitations due to the sandboxed and constrained environments that are Web browsers, latency compensation etc.). An online demo, as well as a GitHub repository for the source code are available.": 0.20190101861953735, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Web Developer and W3C>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Web Developer and W3C_2>>abstract>>In this paper, I discuss arguments in favor and in disfavor of building for the Web. I look at three extraordinary examples of apps built for the Web, and analyze reasons their creators provided for doing so. In continuation, I look at the decline of interest in cross-platform app frameworks with the exception of Flutter, which leads me to the two research questions RQ1 \"Why do people not fully bet on PWA\" and RQ2 \"Why is Flutter so popular\". My hypothesis for why developers don’t more frequently set on the Web is that in many cases they (or their non-technical reporting lines) don’t realize how powerful it has become.

The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.": 0.19510889053344727, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Beyond Facts: 3d

solved by graph signal processing (GSP), which uses low-pass filters to smooth the observed interaction signals on the similarity graph to obtain the prediction signals. However, the interaction signal may not be sufficient to accurately characterize user interests and the low-pass filters may ignore the useful information contained in the high-frequency component of the observed signals, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To this end, we propose a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design the personalized graph signal containing richer user information and construct an augmented similarity graph containing more graph topology information, to more effectively characterize user interests. Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful information in the high-frequency components of the observed signals by combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the personalized graph signal, the augmented similarity graph and the mixed-frequency graph filter by proposing a pipeline consisting of three key steps: pre-processing, graph convolution and post-processing. Extensive experiments show that PGSP can achieve superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art CF methods and, as a nonparametric method, PGSP has very high training efficiency.": 0.10050332546234131}, "What is the expected outcome for papers that do not relate to the web or web-based infrastructures?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_20>>title>>DDPC: Automated Data-Driven Power-Performance Controller Design on-the-fly for Latency-sensitive Web Services": 0.17314952611923218, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_6>>title>>SCTAP: Supporting Scenario-Centric Trigger-Action Programming based on Software-Defined Physical Environments": 0.173464834690094, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_27>>title>>EdgeMove: Pipelining Device-Edge Model Training for Mobile Intelligence": 0.17413532733917236, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_24>>title>>Will Admins Cope?

Social media platforms, such as Twitter, can be serious vectors of misinformation online. In order to better understand the spread of these fake-news, lies, deceptions, and rumours, we analyze the correlations between the following textual features in tweets: emotion, sentiment, political bias, stance, veracity and conspiracy theories. We train several transformer-based classifiers from multiple datasets to detect these textual features and identify potential correlations using conditional distributions of the labels.

(TempWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)_3>>abstract>>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on human behaviors and how it influenced peoples’ interests in cultural products is an unsolved problem. While prior studies mostly adopt subjective surveys to find an answer, these methods are always suffering from high cost, limited size, and subjective bias. Inspired by the rich user-oriented data over the Internet, this work explores the possibility to leverage users’ search logs to reflect humans’ underlying cultural product interests. To further examine how the COVID-19 mobility policy might influence cultural interest changes, we propose a new regression discontinuity design that has the additional potential to predict the recovery phase of peoples’ cultural product interests. By analyzing the 1592 search interest time series in 6 countries, we found different patterns of change in interest in movies, music, and art during the COVID-19 pandemic, but a clear overall incremental increase. Across the six countries we studied, we found that changes in interest in cultural products were found to be strongly correlated with mobility and that as mobility declined, interest in movies, music, and art increased by an average of 35, 27 and 20, respectively, with these changes lasting at least eight weeks.": 0.2030726671218872}, "What is the title of the paper authored by Hao Huang, Keqi Han,

Graphs have become a foundation for sharing data on the web and building intelligent services across many sectors and also within some of the most successful corporations in the world. The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.": 0.10279089212417603}, "What are the practical challenges of ODRL discussed in the paper by Andrea Cimmino, Juan Cano-Benito, and Raúl García-Castro?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_7>>authors>>authors_3>>Qi Liu": 0.2204681634902954, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_2>>authors>>authors_6>>Ryosuke Shibasaki": 0.2213260531425476, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_15>>authors>>authors_3>>Kurt Thomas and Zakir Durumeric": 0.22182059288024902, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_7>>authors>>authors_1>>Shaochen Yu": 0.22213590145111084, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_5>>authors>>authors_3>>Thomas Magelinski and Nicolas Christin": 0.22236394882202148, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_12>>authors>>authors_3>>Evangelos P.

Knowledge graph is the connected data with semantically enriched context.

Gartner predicted that knowledge graph application and graph mining will grow 100% annually to enable more complex and adaptive data science. Graph convolutional neural networks, graph transformer, graph embedding and more have achieved great performance on various downstream tasks. As the size of knowledge graph is growing exponentially, scalable graph solutions are key to store, process, and empower graph AI methods on these large-scale knowledge graphs.

This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text.

preventing and mitigating suicidal ideation and behaviors. With the increasing ubiquity and widespread use of social media, individuals often express and share lived experiences and struggles with mental health. However, there is a gap in our understanding about the existence and effectiveness of the Papageno effect in social media, which we study in this paper. In particular, we adopt a causal-inference framework to examine the impact of exposure to mental health coping stories on individuals on Twitter. We obtain a Twitter dataset with ∼ 2M posts by ∼ 10K individuals. We consider engaging with coping stories as the Treatment intervention, and adopt a stratified propensity score approach to find matched cohorts of Treatment and Control individuals. We measure the psychosocial shifts in affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes in longitudinal Twitter data before and after engaging with the coping stories. Our findings reveal that, engaging with coping stories leads to decreased stress and depression, and improved expressive writing, diversity, and interactivity.

In this short paper, we present the “Solid Data Space” (SDS), a concept for dataspaces that build on top of the (Semantic) Web and Social Linked Data (Solid). Existing Web technologies and Linked Data principles form the foundation for open, decentralized networks for sovereign data exchange between citizens, organizations and companies.

Efficient use of materials and products over time is a critical aspect of CE, helping to reduce CO2 emissions, waste and resource consumption. The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a CE-specific approach that contains information about components and their origin, and can also provide environmental and social impact assessments. However, creating a DPP requires collecting and analyzing data from many different stakeholders along the supply chain and even throughout the product lifecycle. In this paper, we present a concept for the SPACE_DS, which is a data space for circular economy data.

Knowledge enrichment can enable a more comprehensive representation of multimodal data and intuitive decision-making with improved expressiveness and generalizability.

human-computer interaction scenes from traditional mechanical devices and flat screens to the real world, resulting in unconstrained environmental challenges such as complex backgrounds, extreme illumination, depth range differences, and hand-object interaction. The previous hand detection and 3D hand pose estimation methods are usually based on single modality such as RGB or depth data, which are not available in some scenarios in unconstrained environments due to the differences between the two modalities. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal fusion approach, named Scene-Adapt Fusion (SA-Fusion), which can fully utilize the complementarity of RGB and depth modalities in web-based HCI tasks. SA-Fusion can be applied in existing hand detection and 3D hand pose estimation frameworks to boost their performance, and can be further integrated into the prototyping AR system to construct a web-based interactive AR application for unconstrained environments. To evaluate the proposed multimodal fusion method, we conduct two user studies on CUG Hand and DexYCB dataset, to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of accurately detecting hand and estimating 3D hand pose in unconstrained environments and hand-object interaction.": 0.10471785068511963}, "Who are the authors of the paper 'The Harmonic Memory: a Knowledge Graph of harmonic patterns as a trustworthy framework for computational creativity' at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_6>>authors>>authors_3>>Fenglong Su": 0.13314032554626465, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_2>>authors>>authors_3>>Qin Jin": 0.13368088006973267, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_6>>authors>>authors_1>>Zhongwu Chen": 0.13388603925704956, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_18>>authors>>authors_3>>Yulin Shen": 0.1342213749885559, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_8>>authors>>authors_3>>Abhishek Nadgeri": 0.1342543363571167, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_6>>authors>>authors_2>>Chengjin Xu": 0.13425934314727783, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_3>>authors>>authors_1>>Kunpeng Guo": 0.13434326648712158, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_16>>authors>>authors_3>>Qianwen Xiao": 0.1343556046485901, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_5>>authors>>authors_3>>Yunfeng Cai": 0.13452696800231934, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_15>>authors>>authors_3>>Tianyi Li": 0.1346120834350586, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_1>>authors>>authors_3>>Oktie Hassanzadeh": 0.13462835550308228}, "What is the main idea of the paper titled 'Identifying Creative Harmful Memes via Prompt based Approach' presented in the 'The Creative Web' session at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_6>>abstract>>With the advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, virtual displays have become integral to how museums, galleries, and other tourist destinations present their collections to the public. However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations. Through multimodal interaction, we aim to encourage innovation on the Web and create more visually appealing and engaging virtual displays. It is hoped that the greater online art community will gain fresh insight into how people interact with virtual worlds as a result of this work.": 0.13764256238937378, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_1>>abstract>>The creative nature of memes has made it possible for harmful content to spread quickly and widely on the internet. Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods. We conclude with the transferability and robustness of our approach to identify creative harmful memes.": 0.13795924186706543}, "Who are the authors of the research named 'SA-Fusion: Multimodal Fusion

In this paper, we describe a hybrid embedding-based retrieval system for real-time personalized item recommendations on Instacart. Our system addresses unique challenges in the multi-source retrieval system, and includes several key components to make it highly personalized and dynamic. Specifically, our system features a hybrid embedding model that includes a long-term user interests embedding model and a real-time session-based model, which are combined to capture users’ immediate intents and historical interactions. Additionally, we have developed a contextual bandit solution to dynamically adjust the number of candidates from each source and optimally allocate retrieval slots given a limited computational budget. Our modeling and system optimization efforts have enabled us to provide highly personalized item recommendations in real-time at scale to all our customers, including new and long-standing users.":

To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3.

Representing a new paradigm, the Metaverse is made up of virtual worlds developed in extended reality (XR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR) and augmentative reality (AR) technologies. The Metaverse has opened up a plethora of exciting opportunities in which accessibility and inclusive design are important attributes. As tech writer Julie Brehuescu recently wrote for The Drum, “One goal of the metaverse is to replicate the feeling of real-world connection by creating immersive virtual environments. But it may also make the internet more accessible to the more than one billion people who struggle to interact with digital content each day due to neurodivergence, disability or other impairments.” How can the Metaverse adapt to working and learning environments to ensure user needs are met quickly and efficiently? What solutions exist to encourage the autonomy and well-being of people with disabilities and older adults? What are the social, financial, cultural or ethical implications of deploying immersive web solutions without accessibility in mind? While we encourage authors to contribute to the conference on any of the traditional topics covered at W4A, this year we seek to provide an answer to these and other related questions by particularly welcoming submissions that address web-related challenges and/or solutions associated with the following areas": 0.17379719018936157, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Call for Papers>>Accessibility in the Metaverse>>description>>description_1>>This year’s W4A conference theme is “Accessibility in the Metaverse”.

While previous work has documented the importance of manual content moderation, the effects of automated content moderation remain largely unknown. Here, in a large study of Facebook comments (n = 412M), we used a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to measure the impact of automated content moderation on subsequent rule-breaking behavior (number of comments hidden/deleted) and engagement (number of additional comments posted). We found that comment deletion decreased subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments), even among other participants, suggesting that the intervention prevented conversations from derailing. Further, the effect of deletion on the affected user’s subsequent rule-breaking behavior was longer-lived than its effect on reducing commenting in general, suggesting that users were deterred from rule-breaking but not from commenting. In contrast, hiding (rather than deleting) content had small and statistically insignificant effects. Our results suggest that automated content moderation increases adherence to community guidelines.": 0.18576818704605103, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_3>>abstract>>Measuring and assessing the impact and “fairness’’ of recommendation algorithms is central to responsible recommendation efforts. However, the complexity of fairness definitions and the proliferation of fairness metrics in research literature have led to a complex decision-making space. This environment makes it challenging for practitioners to operationalize and pick metrics that work within their unique context. This suggests that practitioners require more decision-making support, but it is not clear what type of support would be beneficial. We conducted a literature review of 24 papers to gather metrics introduced by the research community for measuring fairness in recommendation and ranking systems. We organized these metrics into a ‘decision-tree style’ support framework designed to help practitioners scope fairness objectives and identify fairness metrics relevant to their recommendation domain and application context. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using this framework to assess which challenges practitioners may face when scoping fairness objectives and metrics for their system, and which further support may be needed beyond such tools.": 0.18932569026947021}, "What is the event program for Sunday April 30 at the WWW2023 conference?":

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing. Finally, crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.": 0.2369338870048523, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>authors>>authors_4>>Brian Uzzi": 0.23726814985275269, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_1>>authors>>authors_3>>Jorge Goncalves": 0.2375473976135254}, "What improvements were found in the study 'LLMs to the Moon?

2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_41>>abstract>>Fashion recommendation (FR) has received increasing attention in the research of new types of recommender systems. Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric.": 0.20582711696624756, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_7>>abstract>>In recommender systems, reinforcement learning solutions have effectively boosted recommendation performance because of their ability to capture long-term user-system interaction. However, the action space of the recommendation policy is a list of items, which could be extremely large with a dynamic candidate item pool. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hyper-actor and critic learning framework where the policy decomposes the item list generation process into a hyper-action inference step and an effect-action selection step. The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to stabilize the learning process.

However, previous attempts at heterogeneous micro task assignment based on worker characteristics are limited to using cognitive skills, despite literature emphasising that worker performance varies based on other parameters. This study is an initial step towards understanding whether and how multiple parameters such as cognitive skills, mood, personality, alertness, comprehension skill, and social and physical context of workers can be leveraged in tandem to improve worker performance estimations in heterogeneous micro tasks. Our predictive models indicate that these parameters have varying effects on worker performance in the five task types considered – sentiment analysis, classification, transcription, named entity recognition and bounding box. Moreover, we note 0.003 - 0.018 reduction in mean absolute error of predicted worker accuracy across all tasks, when task assignment is based on models that consider all parameters vs. models that only consider workers’ cognitive skills. Our findings pave the way for the use of holistic approaches in micro task assignment that effectively quantify worker context.": 0.14656054973602295}, "What is the main result of the research titled Autobidding Auctions in the Presence of User Costs presented at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_3>>abstract>>Peer prediction aims to incentivize truthful reports from agents whose reports cannot be assessed with any objective ground truthful information.

A recent line of work studies incentives from the content providers’ point of view. Content providers, e.g., vloggers and bloggers, contribute fresh content and rely on user engagement to create revenue and finance their operations. In this work, we propose a contextual multi-armed bandit setting to model the dependency of content providers on exposure. In our model, the system receives a user context in every round and has to select one of the arms. Every arm is a content provider who must receive a minimum number of pulls every fixed time period (e.g., a month) to remain viable in later rounds; otherwise, the arm departs and is no longer available. The system aims to maximize the users’ (content consumers) welfare. To that end, it should learn which arms are vital and ensure they remain viable by subsidizing arm pulls if needed.

Therefore, synthetic data generated from the real data is increasingly used as a privacy-preserving substitute. In many cases, real data from the web has missing values where the missingness itself possesses important informational content, which domain experts leverage to improve their analysis. However, this information content is lost if either imputation or deletion is used before synthetic data generation. In this paper, we propose several methods to generate synthetic data that preserve both the observable and the missing data distributions.

We also report issues present in prior works that were left unidentified. Having identified the attacks and issues in all prior works, we put forth an SAE system that overcomes these while retaining all the existing salient features. The cryptographic technique of secure multiparty computation (MPC) serves as the primary underlying tool in designing our system. At the heart of our system lies a new duplicity check protocol and an improved matching protocol. We also provide essential features such as allegation modification and deletion, which were absent in the state of the art. To demonstrate feasibility, we benchmark the proposed system with state-of-the-art MPC protocols and report the cost of processing an allegation.

When I say “suddenly” I refer to the Internet’s birthday, October 29, 1969 and how two thirds of the human race, five billion people, are already on the Internet, in only 50 years. Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it.

According to the explorer, we find that more than 75% of slashable Byzantine actions were not slashed. Since Ethereum relies on the “stake-and-slash\" mechanism to align incentives, this finding would at its face value cause concern over Ethereum’s security. However, further investigation reveals that all the apparent unslashed incidents were erroneously recorded due to the explorer’s mishandling of consensus edge cases.

Formally, we consider a dynamic version of the celebrated Eisenberg-Noe model of financial network liabilities, and use this to study the design of external intervention policies. Our controller has a fixed resource budget in each round, and can use this to minimize the effect of demand/supply shocks in the network. We formulate the optimal intervention problem as a Markov Decision Process, and show how we can leverage the problem structure to efficiently compute optimal intervention policies with continuous interventions, and give approximation algorithms in the case of discrete interventions. Going beyond financial networks, we argue that our model captures dynamic network intervention in a much broader class of dynamic demand/supply settings with networked inter-dependencies. To demonstrate this, we apply our intervention algorithms to a wide variety of Web-related application domains, including ridesharing, online transaction platforms, and financial networks with agent mobility; in each case, we study the relationship between node centrality and intervention strength, as well as fairness properties of the optimal interventions.": 0.23950064182281494}, "What is the issue investigated in the 'Ready, Aim, Snipe!

The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau. The International World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2) was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW became an annual event held in late April or early May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.": 0.13108986616134644, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_3>>abstract>>Online social media platforms use automated moderation systems to remove or reduce the visibility of rule-breaking content. While previous work has documented the importance of manual content moderation, the effects of automated content moderation remain largely unknown. Here, in a large study of Facebook comments (n = 412M), we used a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to measure the impact of automated content moderation on subsequent rule-breaking behavior (number of comments hidden/deleted) and engagement (number of additional comments posted). We found that comment deletion decreased subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments), even among other participants, suggesting that the intervention prevented conversations from derailing. Further, the effect of deletion on the affected user’s subsequent rule-breaking behavior was longer-lived than its effect on reducing commenting in general, suggesting that users were deterred from rule-breaking but not from commenting. In contrast, hiding (rather than deleting) content had small and statistically insignificant effects. Our results suggest that automated content moderation increases adherence to community guidelines.": 0.13203001022338867}, "What is the URL for the research paper 'Tutorials at The Web Conference

However, with their inherently recursive message propagation among neighboring nodes, existing GNN-based CF models may generate indistinguishable and inaccurate user (item) representations due to the over-smoothing and noise effect with low-pass Laplacian smoothing operators. In addition, the recursive information propagation with the stacked aggregators in the entire graph structures may result in poor scalability in practical applications. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a simple and effective collaborative filtering model (SimRec) that marries the power of knowledge distillation and contrastive learning. In SimRec, adaptive transferring knowledge is enabled between the teacher GNN model and a lightweight student network, to not only preserve the global collaborative signals, but also address the over-smoothing issue with representation recalibration. Empirical results on public datasets show that SimRec archives better efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation performance compared with various strong baselines.

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.": 0.19274181127548218}, "Who will be delivering the ACM A.M.
