Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track. After this, the submission will be discussed between PC members, the assigned Senior Program Committee (SPC), and track chairs, pre- and post-rebuttal. The papers will then be ranked based on a range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics. Based on this ranking, track chairs will recommend papers for presentation at the conference, inclusion in the proceedings, and awards. Track Chairs (TC) for each track review the paper for fitness to the conference and track, formatting, and page limits, desk-rejecting papers that do not position themselves clearly within the scope of the conference and the track, or do not satisfy formatting requirements."}]
