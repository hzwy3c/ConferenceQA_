The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau. The International World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2) was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW became an annual event held in late April or early May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.": 0.11763471364974976, "WWW2023>>About>>The Web Conference>>The Web Conference_2>>The Conference aims to provide the world with a premier forum for discussion and debate about the evolution of the Web, the standardization of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture.

Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_3>>abstract>>Product attributes can display the selling points of products, helping users find their desired products in search results. However, product attributes are typically incomplete. In e-commerce, products have multimodal features, including original attributes, images, and texts. How to make full use of the multimodal data to complete the missing attributes is the key challenge. To this end, we propose MPKGAC, a powerful three-stream framework that handles multimodal product data for attribute completion. We build a multimodal product knowledge graph (KG) from the multimodal features, and then convert the attribute completion problem into a multimodal KG completion task. MPKGAC encodes each modality separately, fuses them adaptively, and integrates multimodal decoders for prediction. Experiments show that MPKGAC outperforms the best baseline by 6.2% in Hit@1. MPKGAC is employed to enrich selling points of the women’s clothing industry at Alibaba.com.cn and improves the click-through rate (CTR) by a relative 2.14%.": 0.13960009813308716}, "When was the Call for Papers announced for the conference?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>Important Dates>>Paper submission>>February 3, 2023": 0.13048124313354492, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>news>>This edition of The Web Conference Poster and Demos track boosts open science best practices highlighting papers with the ARTIFACT badge.": 0.13494741916656494, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>ProvenanceWeek2023>>Organizers>>Call for Papers>>We invite innovative and creative contributions, including papers outlining new formal approaches to provenance, innovative use of provenance, experience-based insights, and visionary ideas.": 0.13627725839614868, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Industry Proposals>>Important dates>>Full paper>>November 14th, 2022": 0.13637202978134155, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>Important Dates>>Notification to authors>>March 6, 2023": 0.13640832901000977, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>Publication policy>>Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements and page limits of the camera-ready format required by ACM.
