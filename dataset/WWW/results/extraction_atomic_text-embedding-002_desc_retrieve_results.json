Authors are welcome to submit papers that have been published as a preprint on arXiv, or in a non-archival venue like a workshop.\nThis year we will embrace the FAIR principles by collecting structured metadata of the datasets, software, and methods generated by all paper submissions. Authors will be encouraged to add these resources in the EasyChair submission form (together with a brief description).\nACM Policy Against Discrimination: all authors and participants must adhere the the ACM discrimination policy.

SocialNLP has three directions: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. The 11th SocialNLP workshop is held at TheWebConf 2023. We accepted nine papers with acceptance ratio 56%.

Most of the existing BFMs concentrate on maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint, which is insufficient for many applications with complex objectives or constraints. Observing this, the recent studies (e.g., [4, 5, 11]) have considered non-monotone submodular objectives or more complex constraints such as a k-system constraint. In this study, we follow this line of research and propose truthful BFMs with improved performance bounds for non-monotone submodular objectives with or without a k-system constraint. Our BFMs leverage the idea of providing random prices to users while deferring the decision on the final winning set, and are also based on a novel randomized algorithm for the canonical constrained submodular maximization problem achieving better performance bounds compared to the state-of-the-art. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated by extensive experiments on several applications about social network marketing, crowdsourcing and personalized recommendation.": 0.27183061838150024}}
