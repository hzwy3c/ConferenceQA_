Multi-behaviors are often taken in certain orders in real-world applications (e.g., click>cart>buy). In a behavior chain, a latter behavior usually exhibits a stronger signal of user preference than the former one does. Most existing multi-behavior models fail to capture such dependencies in a behavior chain for embedding learning. In this work, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommendation model with cascading graph convolution networks (named MB-CGCN). In MB-CGCN, the embeddings learned from one behavior are used as the input features for the next behavior’s embedding learning after a feature transformation operation. In this way, our model explicitly utilizes the behavior dependencies in embedding learning. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on exploiting multi-behavior data. It outperforms the best baseline by 33.7% and 35.9% on average over the two datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10, respectively.": 0.18815505504608154, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_3>>abstract>>Peer prediction aims to incentivize truthful reports from agents whose reports cannot be assessed with any objective ground truthful information.

However, these guarantees assume agents’ strategies are restricted to be task-independent: an agent’s report on a task is not affected by her information about other tasks.": 0.19280606508255005, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_18>>abstract>>Recommender systems usually rely on observed user interaction data to build personalized recommendation models, assuming that the observed data reflect user interest. However, user interacting with an item may also due to conformity, the need to follow popular items. Most previous studies neglect user’s conformity and entangle interest with it, which may cause the recommender systems fail to provide satisfying results. Therefore, from the cause-effect view, disentangling these interaction causes is a crucial issue. It also contributes to OOD problems, where training and test data are out-of-distribution. Nevertheless, it is quite challenging as we lack the signal to differentiate interest and conformity. The data sparsity of pure cause and the items’ long-tail problem hinder disentangled causal embedding. In this paper, we propose DCCL, a framework that adopts contrastive learning to disentangle these two causes by sample augmentation for interest and conformity respectively. Futhermore, DCCL is model-agnostic, which can be easily deployed in any industrial online system. Extensive experiments are conducted over two real-world datasets and DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on top of various backbone models in various OOD environments. We also demonstrate the performance improvements by online A/B testing on Kuaishou, a billion-user scale short-video recommender system.": 0.1965881586074829, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_18>>abstract>>Item ranking is important to a social media platform’s success. The order in which posts, videos, messages, comments, ads, used products, notifications are presented to a user greatly affects the time spent on the platform, how often they visit it, how much they interact with each other, and the quantity and quality of the content they post. To this end, item ranking algorithms use models that predict the likelihood of different events, e.g., the user liking, sharing, commenting on a video, clicking/converting on an ad, or opening the platform’s app from a notification. Unfortunately, by solely relying on such event-prediction models, social media platforms tend to over optimize for short-term objectives and ignore the long-term effects. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at improving item ranking long-term impact. The approach primarily relies on an ML model that predicts negative user experiences. The model utilizes all available UI events: the details of an action can reveal how positive or negative the user experience has been; for example, a user writing a lengthy report asking for a given video to be taken down, likely had a very negative experience. Furthermore, the model takes into account detected integrity (e.g., hostile speech or graphic violence) and quality (e.g., click or engagement bait) issues with the content. Note that those issues can be perceived very differently from different users. Therefore, developing a personalized model, where a prediction refers to a specific user for a specific piece of content at a specific point in time, is a fundamental design choice in our approach. Besides the personalized ML model, our approach consists of two more pieces: (a) the way the personalized model is integrated with an item ranking algorithm and (b) the metrics, methodology, and success criteria for the long term impact of detecting and limiting negative user experiences. Our evaluation process uses extensive A/B testing on the Facebook platform: we compare the impact of our approach in treatment groups against production control groups. The AB test results indicate a 5% to 50% reduction in hides, reports, and submitted feedback. Furthermore, we compare against a baseline that does not include some of the crucial elements of our approach: the comparison shows our approach has a 100x to 30x lower False Positive Ratio than a baseline.

Multi-behaviors are often taken in certain orders in real-world applications (e.g., click>cart>buy). In a behavior chain, a latter behavior usually exhibits a stronger signal of user preference than the former one does. Most existing multi-behavior models fail to capture such dependencies in a behavior chain for embedding learning. In this work, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommendation model with cascading graph convolution networks (named MB-CGCN). In MB-CGCN, the embeddings learned from one behavior are used as the input features for the next behavior’s embedding learning after a feature transformation operation. In this way, our model explicitly utilizes the behavior dependencies in embedding learning. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on exploiting multi-behavior data. It outperforms the best baseline by 33.7% and 35.9% on average over the two datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10, respectively.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_3>>abstract>>Peer prediction aims to incentivize truthful reports from agents whose reports cannot be assessed with any objective ground truthful information. In the multi-task setting where each agent is asked multiple questions, a sequence of mechanisms have been proposed which are truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be an equilibrium, or even better, informed truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be one of the best-paid equilibria. However, these guarantees assume agents’ strategies are restricted to be task-independent: an agent’s report on a task is not affected by her information about other tasks.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_18>>abstract>>Recommender systems usually rely on observed user interaction data to build personalized recommendation models, assuming that the observed data reflect user interest. However, user interacting with an item may also due to conformity, the need to follow popular items. Most previous studies neglect user’s conformity and entangle interest with it, which may cause the recommender systems fail to provide satisfying results. Therefore, from the cause-effect view, disentangling these interaction causes is a crucial issue. It also contributes to OOD problems, where training and test data are out-of-distribution. Nevertheless, it is quite challenging as we lack the signal to differentiate interest and conformity. The data sparsity of pure cause and the items’ long-tail problem hinder disentangled causal embedding. In this paper, we propose DCCL, a framework that adopts contrastive learning to disentangle these two causes by sample augmentation for interest and conformity respectively. Futhermore, DCCL is model-agnostic, which can be easily deployed in any industrial online system. Extensive experiments are conducted over two real-world datasets and DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on top of various backbone models in various OOD environments. We also demonstrate the performance improvements by online A/B testing on Kuaishou, a billion-user scale short-video recommender system.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_18>>abstract>>Item ranking is important to a social media platform’s success. The order in which posts, videos, messages, comments, ads, used products, notifications are presented to a user greatly affects the time spent on the platform, how often they visit it, how much they interact with each other, and the quantity and quality of the content they post. To this end, item ranking algorithms use models that predict the likelihood of different events, e.g., the user liking, sharing, commenting on a video, clicking/converting on an ad, or opening the platform’s app from a notification. Unfortunately, by solely relying on such event-prediction models, social media platforms tend to over optimize for short-term objectives and ignore the long-term effects. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at improving item ranking long-term impact. The approach primarily relies on an ML model that predicts negative user experiences. The model utilizes all available UI events: the details of an action can reveal how positive or negative the user experience has been; for example, a user writing a lengthy report asking for a given video to be taken down, likely had a very negative experience. Furthermore, the model takes into account detected integrity (e.g., hostile speech or graphic violence) and quality (e.g., click or engagement bait) issues with the content. Note that those issues can be perceived very differently from different users.

In Brazil, the teaching and learning process in several areas has been stimulated through Academic Competitions generally called Knowledge Olympics, which are essentially student contests that aim to encourage, find talent and awaken interest in the field knowledge presented in the competition. It was precisely for this purpose that the Brazilian Investment Olympics (OBInvest) was born, aiming to democratize access to education and promote reflections on economic and financial issues, through a FL perspective for high school students from all over the country. One of OBInvest’s objectives is to help boosting the development of computational tools, aiming to provide easier access to fundamental data for decision-making in the field of finance.

Given the impressive capabilities of pre-trained large language models [4, 11], we ask whether they can help automate such analysis. We refer to this task as extractive aspect-based contrastive summarization which involves constructing a structured summary that compares the choices along relevant aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel method called STRUM for this task that can generalize across domains without requiring any human-written summaries or fixed aspect list as supervision. Given a set of relevant input webpages, STRUM solves this problem using two pre-trained T5-based [11] large language models: first one fine-tuned for aspect and value extraction [14], and second one fine-tuned for natural language inference [13].

Ideally, we expect the better the teacher is, the better the student performs. However, this expectation does not always come true. It is common that a strong teacher model results in a bad student via distillation due to the nonnegligible gap between teacher and student. To bridge the gap, we propose PROD, a PROgressive Distillation method, for dense retrieval. PROD consists of a teacher progressive distillation and a data progressive distillation to gradually improve the student.

They require some kind of reasoning since web documents and knowledge bases, indispensable sources of information, rarely store direct answers to questions, such as, “Are there more astronauts or Physics Nobel Laureates?” We tackle questions on class cardinality comparison by tapping into three sources for absolute cardinalities as well as the cardinalities of orthogonal subgroups of the classes. We propose novel techniques for aggregating signals with partial coverage for more reliable estimates and evaluate them on a dataset of 4005 class pairs, achieving an accuracy of 83.7%.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_7>>abstract>>Comparative decisions, such as picking between two cars or deciding between two hiking trails, require the users to visit multiple webpages and contrast the choices along relevant aspects. Given the impressive capabilities of pre-trained large language models [4, 11], we ask whether they can help automate such analysis. We refer to this task as extractive aspect-based contrastive summarization which involves constructing a structured summary that compares the choices along relevant aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel method called STRUM for this task that can generalize across domains without requiring any human-written summaries or fixed aspect list as supervision. Given a set of relevant input webpages, STRUM solves this problem using two pre-trained T5-based [11] large language models: first one fine-tuned for aspect and value extraction [14], and second one fine-tuned for natural language inference [13]. We showcase the abilities of our method across different domains, identify shortcomings, and discuss questions that we believe will be critical in this new line of research.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_17>>abstract>>Knowledge distillation is an effective way to transfer knowledge from a strong teacher to an efficient student model. Ideally, we expect the better the teacher is, the better the student performs. However, this expectation does not always come true. It is common that a strong teacher model results in a bad student via distillation due to the nonnegligible gap between teacher and student. To bridge the gap, we propose PROD, a PROgressive Distillation method, for dense retrieval. PROD consists of a teacher progressive distillation and a data progressive distillation to gradually improve the student. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization term in each distillation process.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving. Understanding the global landscape surrounding tax evasion opportunities in decentralized finance represents a first step at preventing corporate capital flight of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_8>>abstract>>Further, ZKP mixers advertise their level of privacy through a so-called anonymity set size, which similarly to k-anonymity allows a user to hide among a set of k other users.
