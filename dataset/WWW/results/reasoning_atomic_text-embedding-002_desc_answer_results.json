The reviews focus on technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, and papers are ranked based on these factors. Track Chairs (TC) also review the paper for fitness to the conference and track, formatting, and page limits and may reject papers that do not meet these standards. For the PhD Symposium, all submissions are reviewed by the members of the Program Committee of the PhD Symposium. Students of accepted submissions will have the opportunity to discuss their submissions in more detail and receive additional feedback from mentors."}]
