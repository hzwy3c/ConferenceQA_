This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients).

For delivery systems, improving address resolution positively impacts multiple downstream systems such as geocoding, route planning and delivery time estimations, leading to an efficient and reliable delivery experience, both for customers as well as delivery agents. Our proposed approach jointly leverages address text, past delivery information and concepts from graph theory to retrieve informative and diverse record pairs to label. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach on manually curated dataset across addresses from India (IN) and United Arab Emirates (UAE). We achieved absolute improvement in recall on average across IN and UAE while preserving precision over the existing production system. We also introduce delivery point (DP) geocode learning for cold-start addresses as a downstream application of address resolution. In addition to offline evaluation, we also performed online A/B experiments which show that when the production model is augmented with active learnt record pairs, the delivery precision improved by and delivery defects reduced by on an average across shipments from IN and UAE.": 0.1176404356956482,

The model uses an intent topological tree to guide the search for the user intent using large language models (LLMs). The intents are resolved based on semantic similarities between user utterances and the text descriptions of the internal nodes of the intent tree or the intent examples in the leaf nodes of the tree. Our results show that an off-the-shelf language model can work reasonably well in a large enterprise deployment without fine-tuning, and its performance can be further improved with fine-tuning as more domain-specific data becomes available. We also show that the fine-tuned language model meets and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in resolving conversation intents without training classifiers.

Its deployment also needs to consider challenges in scalability and downstream integration in order to translate modeling advances into better search result relevance. In this paper we present HierCat, the query categorization system at Facebook Marketplace. HierCat addresses these challenges by leveraging multi-task pre-training of dual-encoder architectures with a hierarchical inference step to effectively learn from weakly supervised training data mined from searcher engagement. We show that HierCat not only outperforms popular methods in offline experiments, but also leads to 1.4% improvement in NDCG and 4.3% increase in searcher engagement at Facebook Marketplace Search in two weeks of online A/B testing.": 0.14287519454956055,

When I say “suddenly” I refer to the Internet’s birthday, October 29, 1969 and how two thirds of the human race, five billion people, are already on the Internet, in only 50 years. Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it. GPT is writing my lecture now.": 0.16275626420974731,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_22>>abstract>>Vector quantization techniques, such as Product Quantization (PQ), play a vital role in approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNs) and maximum inner product search (MIPS) owing to their remarkable search and storage efficiency. However, the indexes in vector quantization cannot be trained together with the inference models since data indexing is not differentiable. To this end, differentiable vector quantization approaches, such as DiffPQ and DeepPQ, have been recently proposed, but existing methods have two drawbacks. First, they do not impose any constraints on codebooks, such that the resultant codebooks lack diversity, leading to limited retrieval performance. Second, since data indexing resorts to operator, differentiability is usually achieved by either relaxation or Straight-Through Estimation (STE), which leads to biased gradient and slow convergence. To address these problems, we propose a Differentiable Optimized Product Quantization method (DOPQ) and beyond in this paper. Particularly, each data is projected into multiple orthogonal spaces, to generate multiple views of data. Thus, each codebook is learned with one view of data, guaranteeing the diversity of codebooks. Moreover, instead of simple differentiable relaxation, DOPQ optimizes the loss based on direct loss minimization, significantly reducing the gradient bias problem. Finally, DOPQ is evaluated with seven datasets of both recommendation and image search tasks. Extensive experimental results show that DOPQ outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.": 0.13435828685760498

Asking clarifying questions in conversational search has been widely studied and considered an effective solution to resolve query ambiguity. Existing work have explored various approaches for clarifying question ranking and generation. However, due to the lack of real conversational search data, they have to use artificial datasets for training, which limits their generalizability to real-world search scenarios. As a result, the industry has shown reluctance to implement them in reality, further suspending the availability of real conversational search interaction data. The above dilemma can be formulated as a cold start problem of clarifying question generation and conversational search in general. Furthermore, even if we do have large-scale conversational logs, it is not realistic to gather training data that can comprehensively cover all possible queries and topics in open-domain search scenarios. The risk of fitting bias when training a clarifying question retrieval/generation model on incomprehensive dataset is thus another important challenge.": 0.12259727716445923

Clustering such trails into groups with a common sequence pattern can reveal significant structure in human behavior that can lead to improving user experience through better recommendations, and even prevent suicides [14]. One approach to modeling this problem mathematically is as a mixture of Markov chains.

Many methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks. However, most of the current methods present one or more of the following problems: (i) They only consider fact triplets, while ignoring the ontology information of knowledge graphs. (ii) The obtained embeddings do not contain much semantic information. Therefore, using these embeddings for semantic tasks is problematic. (iii) They do not enable large-scale training. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the ontology of knowledge graphs and partitions the knowledge graph based on classes to include more semantic information for parallel training of large-scale knowledge graph embeddings.

Following a short introduction motivating the reason why this issue has to be considered as pivotal both for the Web and for the society, the main problem raised by the research will be identified, namely, whether an action taken against a person, that in real-life would be a criminal conduct, is considerable as a crime in the Metaverse as well. A short assessment of the (very little so far) current state of the art, as well as the proposed approach and methodology will be then overviewed; finally, the contribution shows its current results, and concludes stating that countries are highly encouraged to shape respective criminal frameworks when applied to the Metaverse, and that the international community should consider the topic as a priority in its agenda.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_4>>abstract>>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) form the backbone of many knowledge dependent applications such as search engines and digital personal assistants. KGs are generally constructed either manually or automatically using a variety of extraction techniques applied over multiple data sources. Due to the diverse quality of these data sources, there are likely anomalies introduced into any KG. Hence, it is unrealistic to expect a perfect archive of knowledge. Given how large KGs can be, manual validation is impractical, necessitating an automated approach for anomaly detection in KGs. To improve KG quality, and to identify interesting and abnormal triples (edges) and entities (nodes) that are worth investigating, we introduce SEKA, a novel unsupervised approach to detect anomalous triples and entities in a KG using both the structural characteristics and the content of edges and nodes of the graph. While an anomaly can be an interesting or unusual discovery, such as a fraudulent transaction requiring human intervention, anomaly detection can also identify potential errors. We propose a novel approach named Corroborative Path Algorithm to generate a matrix of semantic features, which we then use to train a one-class Support Vector Machine to identify abnormal triples and entities with no dependency on external sources. We evaluate our approach on four real-world KGs demonstrating the ability of SEKA to detect anomalies, and to outperform comparative baselines.": 0.13799232244491577

Albeit its supreme model accuracy, DL imposes a heavy burden on devices as it incurs overwhelming system overhead to execute DL models, especially on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge devices. Collaborative inference is a promising approach to supporting DL models, by which the data owner (the victim) runs the first layers of the model on her local device and then a cloud provider (the adversary) runs the remaining layers of the model. Compared to offloading the entire model to the cloud, the collaborative inference approach is more data privacy-preserving as the owner’s model input is not exposed to outsiders. However, we show in this paper that the adversary can restore the victim’s model input by exploiting the output of the victim’s local model. Our attack is dubbed Ginver 1: Generative model inversion attacks against collaborative inference. Once trained, Ginver can infer the victim’s unseen model inputs without remaking the inversion attack model and thus has the generative capability. We extensively evaluate Ginver under different settings (e.g., white-box and black-box of the victim’s local model) and applications (e.g., CIFAR10 and FaceScrub datasets). The experimental results show that Ginver recovers high-quality images from the victims.": 0.13525444269180298,

The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.": 0.12743878364562988,

While current studies solely rely on graph-based fraud detection approaches, it is argued that they may not be well-suited for dealing with highly repetitive, skew-distributed and heterogeneous Ethereum transactions. To address these challenges, we propose BERT4ETH, a universal pre-trained Transformer encoder that serves as an account representation extractor for detecting various fraud behaviors on Ethereum. BERT4ETH features the superior modeling capability of Transformer to capture the dynamic sequential patterns inherent in Ethereum transactions, and addresses the challenges of pre-training a BERT model for Ethereum with three practical and effective strategies, namely repetitiveness reduction, skew alleviation and heterogeneity modeling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that BERT4ETH outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant enhancements in terms of the phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks.

The tool evaluates the domain coverage and correctness of parent-child relations of a given ontology based on domain information derived from a text corpus representing the domain. The tool provides both overall statistics and detailed analysis of sub-graphs of the ontology.

The Accord Project provides an open-source SLC framework containing three main modules: Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo. Currently, we need lawyers, programmers, and clients to work together with great effort to create a usable SLC using the Accord Project. This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project’s Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text. We also delve into some limitations and possible future research for the proposed pipeline. Finally, we describe a web interface enabling users to build SLCs.

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations.

The smart city hub (SCHub) introduces a new concept that aims to homogenize data, service, human and material flows in cities. A proof of concept is based on non-typical data flows, like the ones that are collected by biotechnological activities, like Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally. Most of the diet related NCDs are related to the gut microbiome, the microbial community that resides in our gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance or loss of microbiome diversity is one of the main factors leading to NCDs by affecting various functions, including energy metabolism, intestinal permeability, and brain function. Gut dysbiosis is reflected in altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by the gut microbiota. A microcapsule system can play the role of a sensor that collects data from the local community and transmits it to the SCHub in order for the doctors to receive the appropriate patients information and define the appropriate treatment method; for the city to process anonymized information and measure community's health in diet terms.

It is important to make conscious decisions to keep harmony in sustainability. There are multiple frameworks to evaluate how sustainability is measured and to understand how sustainable a place is, be it a city or a region, and one such framework is the Circles of Sustainability. Though these frameworks offer good solutions, it is a challenge to collect relevant data to make the framework widely usable. This paper focuses on this specific issue by utilizing the methodology introduced in the framework and applying it practically to better understand how sustainable our cities and society are. We present a unique web-based application which utilizes publicly accessible data to compute sustainability scores and rank for every city and presents the results in an intelligent and easy to comprehend visual interface. The paper also discusses the technical difficulties associated with creating such an application, including data collection, data processing, data integration, and scoring algorithm. The paper concludes by discussing the needs for such practical solutions for promoting sustainable urban development.": 0.11415594816207886,

Aggregating heterogeneous healthcare data becomes doable which is essential for evidence-based care.

Due to the increasing popularity of this business model, thousands of small producers and re-sellers are starting to depend on these platforms for their livelihood; thus, it is important to provide fair earning opportunities to them. The enormous product space in such platforms prohibits manual search, and motivates the need for recommendation algorithms to effectively allocate product exposure and, consequently, earning opportunities. In this work, we focus on the fairness of such allocations in social commerce platforms and formulate the problem of assigning products to re-sellers as a fair division problem with indivisible items under two-sided cardinality constraints, wherein each product must be given to at least a certain number of re-sellers and each re-seller must get a certain number of products.": 0.11430132389068604,

In this work, we focus on the fairness of such allocations in social commerce platforms and formulate the problem of assigning products to re-sellers as a fair division problem with indivisible items under two-sided cardinality constraints, wherein each product must be given to at least a certain number of re-sellers and each re-seller must get a certain number of products.": 0.11486828327178955,

However, the complexity of fairness definitions and the proliferation of fairness metrics in research literature have led to a complex decision-making space. This environment makes it challenging for practitioners to operationalize and pick metrics that work within their unique context. This suggests that practitioners require more decision-making support, but it is not clear what type of support would be beneficial. We conducted a literature review of 24 papers to gather metrics introduced by the research community for measuring fairness in recommendation and ranking systems. We organized these metrics into a ‘decision-tree style’ support framework designed to help practitioners scope fairness objectives and identify fairness metrics relevant to their recommendation domain and application context. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using this framework to assess which challenges practitioners may face when scoping fairness objectives and metrics for their system, and which further support may be needed beyond such tools.": 0.1136777400970459

However, the size of different item groups (specified by item attribute) is usually unevenly distributed. We empirically find that the commonly used uniform negative sampling strategy for pairwise algorithms (e.g., BPR) can inherit such data bias and oversample the majority item group as negative instances, severely countering group fairness on the item side. In this paper, we propose a Fairly adaptive Negative sampling approach (FairNeg), which improves item group fairness via adaptively adjusting the group-level negative sampling distribution in the training process. In particular, it first perceives the model’s unfairness status at each step and then adjusts the group-wise sampling distribution with an adaptive momentum update strategy for better facilitating fairness optimization. Moreover, a negative sampling distribution Mixup mechanism is proposed, which gracefully incorporates existing importance-aware sampling techniques intended for mining informative negative samples, thus allowing for achieving multiple optimization purposes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show our proposed method’s superiority in group fairness enhancement and fairness-utility tradeoff.": 0.12934303283691406

However, it is unclear to what extent LMs “reuse” a training corpus. For instance, models can generate paraphrased sentences that are contextually similar to training samples. In this work, therefore, we study three types of plagiarism (i.e., verbatim, paraphrase, and idea) among GPT-2 generated texts, in comparison to its training data, and further analyze the plagiarism patterns of fine-tuned LMs with domain-specific corpora which are extensively used in practice. Our results suggest that (1) three types of plagiarism widely exist in LMs beyond memorization, (2) both size and decoding methods of LMs are strongly associated with the degrees of plagiarism they exhibit, and (3) fine-tuned LMs’ plagiarism patterns vary based on their corpus similarity and homogeneity. Given that a majority of LMs’ training data is scraped from the Web without informing content owners, their reiteration of words, phrases, and even core ideas from training sets into generated texts has ethical implications. Their patterns are likely to exacerbate as both the size of LMs and their training data increase, raising concerns about indiscriminately pursuing larger models with larger training corpora. Plagiarized content can also contain individuals’ personal and sensitive information. These findings overall cast doubt on the practicality of current LMs in mission-critical writing tasks and urge more discussions around the observed phenomena.

We then propose a downscaling DNN and a mobile-specific optimized lightweight super-resolution DNN to enhance the performance. Finally, a novel reinforcement learning-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithm is proposed to verify the performance of BiSR on real network traces. Our evaluation, using a full system implementation, shows that BiSR saves 26% of bitrate compared to the traditional H.264 codec and improves the SSIM of video by 3.7% compared to the prior state-of-the-art.

Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system. Typing errors make the problem even more challenging. Streaming services uses spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features to address this issue up to certain extent. Auto-suggest fails when user searches keywords not in scope of the auto-suggest.

This problem is aggravated when there is no behavioral data available for new content. Poor quality recommendation for these items lead to user dissatisfaction and short content shelf-life. In this paper we propose a solution MEMER (Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations), that utilises the multimodal semantic information of content and uses it to generate better quality embeddings for early-stage items. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by extending it to various explicit and implicit user actions. Using these learnt embeddings, we conduct offline and online experiments to verify its effectiveness. The predicted embeddings show significant gains in online early-stage experiments for both videos and images (videos:  44% relative gain in click through rate,  46% relative gain in explicit engagements,  9% relative gain in successful video play,  20% relative reduction in skips, images:  56% relative gain in explicit engagements).

An entity can be a person, organization, work-of-art, etc., while an event, such as the Opioid epidemic, occurs at specific point(s) in time. ELTE first extracts key-phrases from episode title and description metadata. It then uses entity linking to canonicalize them against Wikipedia knowledge base (KB), ensuring that the topics exist in the real world. ELTE also models NIL-predictions for entity or event topics that are not in the KB, as well as topics that are not of entity or event type. To test the model, we construct a podcast topic database of 1166 episodes from various categories. Each episode comes with a Wiki-link annotated main topic or NIL-prediction. ELTE produces the best overall Exact Match EM score of .84, with by-far the best EM of .89 among the entity or event type episodes, as well as NIL-predictions for episodes without entity or event main topic (EM score of .86).": 0.08645200729370117,

In non-English speaking countries like India, Nepal and many others, the regional titles are transliterated from native language to English and are being searched in English. Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system. Typing errors make the problem even more challenging. Streaming services uses spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features to address this issue up to certain extent. Auto-suggest fails when user searches keywords not in scope of the auto-suggest.

Search engine retrieves the result based on the defined relevancy algorithm. When a user searches a keyword, search engine constructs the search query based on the defined searchable fields/attributes along with configured relevancy algorithm. Position of the item retrieved in search results is determined by the search algorithm based on the search term. The results are further refined or ranked based on different click stream signals, product features, market data to provide much relevant results. Personalisation provides the ranked the list of items for a given user based on past purchases. Personalisation is agnostic of search query and takes user id, cart additions, site taxonomy and user’s shopping history as input signals.

Exploring and mining HINs relies on metapath queries that identify pairs of entities connected by relationships of diverse semantics. While the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads on large, web-scale HINs is highly demanding in computational cost, current approaches do not exploit interrelationships among the queries. In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos  accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios.": 0.14964592456817627,

In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries. The inferred high quality queries will be returned to the users to help them search with ease. Moreover, all the high-quality candidate nodes will be re-ranked according to the inferred queries. The experiment results show that our proposed method can recommend high-quality query graphs to users and improve the question answering accuracy.": 0.11446487903594971,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_3>>abstract>>In conference peer review, reviewers are often asked to provide “bids” on each submitted paper that express their interest in reviewing that paper. A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding. The performance of these detection algorithms can be taken as a baseline for future research on detecting malicious bidding.": 0.10572493076324463,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_2>>abstract>>Extensive literature argues that crowds possess essential collective intelligence benefits that allow superior decision-making by untrained individuals working in low-information environments. Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign. Our findings broaden the field of crowd-aware system design and inform discussions about the augmentation of traditional financing systems with tech innovations.": 0.12240290641784668,

A general framework is to extract supporting evidence from the table and text and then perform numerical reasoning over extracted evidence for inferring the answer. However, existing models are vulnerable to missing supporting evidence, which limits their performance. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic-Oriented Hierarchical Graph (SoarGraph) that models the semantic relationships and dependencies among the different elements (e.g., question, table cells, text paragraphs, quantities, and dates) using hierarchical graphs to facilitate supporting evidence extraction and enhance numerical reasoning capability. We conduct our experiments on two popular benchmarks, FinQA and TAT-QA datasets, and the results show that our SoarGraph significantly outperforms all strong baselines, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness.": 0.12396126985549927,

We propose an anomaly detection approach based on network analysis to help AFC officers navigating through the high load of information that is typical of AFC data-driven scenarios. By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network metrics that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the metric-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system. This approach represents a preliminary step in the automation of AFC and AML processes, serving the purpose of facilitating the work of AFC officers by providing them with a top-down view of the picture emerging from financial data.": 0.09911215305328369,

Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains.

Our approach combines results from different learning-based methods to discover insights automatically and generalizes to a variety of attribute types (e.g., categorical, numerical, and temporal), including non-trivial combinations of these attribute types.

In performing clustering, a similarity measure, which defines how similar a pair of data objects are, plays an important role. A similarity measure is employed by considering a target dataset’s characteristics. Current similarity measures (or distances) do not reflect the distribution of data objects in a dataset at all. From the clustering point of view, this fact may limit the clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose c-affinity, a new notion of a similarity measure that reflects the distribution of objects in the given dataset from a clustering point of view. We design c-affinity between any two objects to have a higher value as they are more likely to belong to the same cluster by learning the data distribution. We use random walk with restart (RWR) on the k-nearest neighbor graph of the given dataset to measure (1) how similar a pair of objects are and (2) how densely other objects are distributed between them. Via extensive experiments on sixteen synthetic and real-world datasets, we verify that replacing the existing similarity measure with our c-affinity improves the clustering accuracy significantly.": 0.11117160320281982,

The sheer volume of interactions has also made it possible to innovate and experiment continuously in a data-driven fashion, based on users’ interactions and feedback.

Sensor and online crowd-sourced data combined with machine learning methods have provided a recent breakthrough in poverty map inference. However, these methods do not capture local wealth fluctuations, and are not optimized to produce accountable results that guarantee accurate predictions to all sub-populations. Here, we propose a pipeline of machine learning models to infer the mean and standard deviation of wealth across multiple geographically clustered populated places, and illustrate their performance in Sierra Leone and Uganda. These models leverage seven independent and freely available feature sources based on satellite images, and metadata collected via online crowd-sourcing and social media. Our models show that combined metadata features are the best predictors of wealth in rural areas, outperforming image-based models, which are the best for predicting the highest wealth quintiles. Our results recover the local mean and variation of wealth, and correctly capture the positive yet non-monotonous correlation between them. We further demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of model transfer across countries and the effects of data recency and other biases. Our methodology provides open tools to build towards more transparent and interpretable models to help governments and NGOs to make informed decisions based on data availability, urbanization level, and poverty thresholds.": 0.12576603889465332,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_28>>abstract>>Monitoring sustainable development goals requires accurate and timely socioeconomic statistics, while ubiquitous and frequently-updated urban imagery in web like satellite/street view images has emerged as an important source for socioeconomic prediction. Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines. Especially, our proposed KnowCL model can apply to both satellite and street imagery with both effectiveness and transferability achieved, which provides insights into urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction.": 0.12587767839431763,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web4Good>>SESSION: Web4Good_8>>abstract>>The widespread misinformation on the Web has raised many concerns with serious societal consequences. In this paper, we study a critical type of online misinformation, namely fauxtography, where the image and associated text of a social media post jointly convey a questionable or false sense. In particular, we focus on a sparse semi-supervised fauxtography detection problem, which aims to accurately identify fauxtography by only using the sparsely annotated ground truth labels of social media posts. Our problem is motivated by the key limitation of current fauxtography detection approaches that often require a large amount of expensive and inefficient manual annotations to train an effective fauxtography detection model. We identify two key technical challenges in solving the problem: 1) it is non-trivial to train an accurate detection model given the sparse fauxtography annotations, and 2) it is difficult to extract the heterogeneous and complicated fauxtography features from the multi-modal social media posts for accurate fauxtography detection. To address the above challenges, we propose ContrastFaux, a multi-view contrastive learning framework that jointly explores the sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multi-modal posts to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. Evaluation results on two social media datasets demonstrate that ContrastFaux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning fauxtography detection baselines by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy.": 0.08847886323928833,

In mental health, individuals experiencing an Eating Disorder (ED) are often hesitant to seek help through conventional healthcare services. However, many people seek help with diet and body image issues on social media. To better distinguish at-risk users who may need help for an ED from those who are simply commenting on ED in social environments, highly sophisticated approaches are required. Assessment of ED risks in such a situation can be done in various ways, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hence, there is a need for and potential benefit of a more complex multimodal approach. To this end, we collect historical tweets, user biographies, and online behaviours of relevant users from Twitter, and generate a reasonably large labelled benchmark dataset. Thereafter, we develop an advanced multimodal deep learning model called EDNet using these data to identify the different types of users with ED engagement (e.g., potential ED sufferers, healthcare professionals, or communicators) and distinguish them from those not experiencing EDs on Twitter. EDNet consists of five deep neural network layers. With the help of its embedding, representation and behaviour modeling layers, it effectively learns the multimodalities of social media. In our experiments, EDNet consistently outperforms all the baseline techniques by significant margins. It achieves an accuracy of up to 94.32% and F1 score of up to 93.91% F1 score. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study to propose a multimodal approach for user-level classification according to their engagement with ED content on social media.": 0.11493313312530518

Most research focuses on high-resource languages. However, malicious actors share content across countries and languages, including low-resource ones. Here, we investigate whether and to what extent malicious actors can be detected in low-resource language settings. We discovered that a high number of accounts posting in Tagalog were suspended as part of Twitter’s crackdown on interference operations after the 2016 US Presidential election. By combining text embedding and transfer learning, our framework can detect, with promising accuracy, malicious users posting in Tagalog without any prior knowledge or training on malicious content in that language. We first learn an embedding model for each language, namely a high-resource language (English) and a low-resource one (Tagalog), independently. Then, we learn a mapping between the two latent spaces to transfer the detection model. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and yields marked advantages in settings with very limited training data—the norm when dealing with detecting malicious activity in online platforms.": 0.15400999784469604,

Finding groups of nodes that form strongly stable agreements and participate in collective conflicts with other groups is an important problem in this context. Previous works approach this problem by finding balanced subgraphs, in which the polarity measure is optimized, that result in large subgraphs without a clear notion of agreement or conflict. In real-world signed networks, balanced subgraphs are often not polarized as in the case of a subgraph with only positive edges. To remedy this issue, we leverage the notion of cohesion — we find pairs of cohesively polarized communities where each node in a community is positively connected to nodes in the same community and negatively connected to nodes in the other community. To capture the cohesion along with the polarization, we define a new measure, dichotomy. We leverage the balanced triangles, which model the cohesion and polarization at the same time, to design a heuristic that results in good seedbeds for polarized communities in real-world signed networks. Then, we introduce the electron decomposition which finds cohesively polarized communities with high dichotomy score. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method finds cohesively polarized communities and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to several measures. Moreover, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing methods and practical for large-scale networks.": 0.12464481592178345

In this work, we conducted qualitative content analyses on risky media content flagged by youth participants and research assistants of similar ages to explore contextual dimensions of youth online risks. The contextual risk dimensions were then used to inform semi- and self-supervised state-of-the-art vision transformers to automate the process of identifying risky images shared by youth.

The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.": 0.088054358959198,

This article presents several challenges identified in the context of the European project AURORAL in which ODRL is used to express privacy policies for Smart Communities and Rural Areas. The article presents that some challenges should be addressed directly by the ODRL standardisation group to achieve the best course of action, although others exists. For others, the authors have presented a potential solution, in particular, for considering dynamic values coming from external data sources into privacy policies. Finally, the last challenge is an open research question, since it revolves around the interoperability of privacy policies that belong to different systems and that are expressed with different privacy languages.": 0.1634560227394104,
        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_67>>abstract>>The privacy of the data provided by available sources is one of the major concerns of our era. In order to address this challenge, the W3C has promoted recommendations to allow expressing privacy policies. One of these recommendations is the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) vocabulary. Although this standard has wide adoption, it is not suitable in domains such as IoT, Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing, or discovery. The reason behind is the fact that ODRL privacy policies are not able to cope with dynamic information that may come from external sources of data and, therefore, these policies can not define privacy restrictions upon data that is not already written in the policy beforehand. In this demo paper, a solution to this challenge is presented. It is shown how ODRL policies can overcome the aforementioned limitation by being combined with a mapping language for RDF materialisation. The article shows how ODRL policies are able to consider data coming from an external data source when they are solved, in particular, a weather forecast API that provides temperature values. The demonstration defines an ODRL policy that grants access to a resource only when the temperature of the API is above a certain value.": 0.16661375761032104

It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). We implemented our approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric.": 0.13713949918746948,

Learning Analytics is the process of measuring, collecting, recording, and analysing this Student Activity Data. Predictive Learning Analytics, a sub-field of Learning Analytics, can help to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or failing, as well as students who are close to a grade boundary. Course tutors can use the insights provided by the analyses to offer timely assistance to these students. Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.": 0.12615376710891724,

This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of the metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above problems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving features designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for metaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to participate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational power, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only protects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high computing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many studies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some of the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with unlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse and FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse technologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the Internet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality. Finally, we discuss some key challenges and promising directions of FL4M in detail. In summary, we hope that our up-to-date brief survey can help people better understand FL4M and build a fair, open, and secure metaverse.": 0.11129385232925415,

This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text. Our experimental results on the TLS-Covid19 test collection demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.": 0.13590556383132935,

Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect). The extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of computational complexity, number of parameters, and latency measures.": 0.1921156644821167

Most of the existing methods essentially optimize a Frobenius-like distance or ranking-based loss, ignoring the underlying geometry of graph data. Optimal transport (OT), together with Wasserstein distance, has emerged to be a powerful approach accounting for the underlying geometry explicitly. Promising as it might be, the state-of-the-art OT-based alignment methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) effectiveness due to the insufficient use of topology and consistency information and (2) scalability due to the non-convex formulation and repeated computationally costly loss calculation. In this paper, we propose a position-aware regularized optimal transport framework for network alignment named PARROT. To tackle the effectiveness issue, the proposed PARROT captures topology information by random walk with restart, with three carefully designed consistency regularization terms. To tackle the scalability issue, the regularized OT problem is decomposed into a series of convex subproblems and can be efficiently solved by the proposed constrained proximal point method with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves significant improvements in both effectiveness and scalability, outperforming the state-of-the-art network alignment methods and speeding up existing OT-based methods by up to 100 times.": 0.13333970308303833,

In this short paper, we present the “Solid Data Space” (SDS), a concept for dataspaces that build on top of the (Semantic) Web and Social Linked Data (Solid). Existing Web technologies and Linked Data principles form the foundation for open, decentralized networks for sovereign data exchange between citizens, organizations and companies. Domain-specific dataspace implementations can extend the agreements for communication and collaboration to enable specific functionality. We compare the SDS with principles and components of the emerging International Data Spaces to identify similarities and point out technological differences.": 0.10498642921447754,

Definitions range from (i) an abstraction for data management in an identifiable scope [15] over (iii) a multi-sided data platform connecting participants in an ecosystem [21] to (iii) interlinking data towards loosely connected (global) information [17]. Many implementations and scientific notions follow different interpretations of the term dataspace, but agree on some use of semantic technologies. For example, dataspaces such as the European Open Science Cloud and the German National Research Data Infrastructure are committed to applying the FAIR principles [11, 16]. Dataspaces built on top of Gaia-X are using semantic methods for service Self-Descriptions [13]. This paper investigates ongoing dataspace efforts and aims to provide insights on the definition of the term dataspace, the usage of semantics and FAIR principles, and future directions for the role of semantics in dataspaces.": 0.10839110612869263

Common reference dataspace architectures assume that sources publish their own domain-specific schema. These schemas, also known as semantic models, can only be partially created automatically and require oversight and refinement by human modellers. Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine.

However, black-box approaches have raised fundamental concerns for ethics, accountability, explainability, and musical plausibility. To enable trustworthy machine creativity, we introduce the Harmonic Memory, a Knowledge Graph (KG) of harmonic patterns extracted from a large and heterogeneous musical corpus. By leveraging a cognitive model of tonal harmony, chord progressions are segmented into meaningful structures, and patterns emerge from their comparison via harmonic similarity. Akin to a music memory, the KG holds temporal connections between consecutive patterns, as well as salient similarity relationships. After demonstrating the validity of our choices, we provide examples of how this design enables novel pathways for combinational creativity. The memory provides a fully accountable and explainable framework to inspire and support creative professionals – allowing for the discovery of progressions consistent with given criteria, the recomposition of harmonic sections, but also the co-creation of new progressions.": 0.11181902885437012,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_1>>abstract>>The creative nature of memes has made it possible for harmful content to spread quickly and widely on the internet. Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods. We conclude with the transferability and robustness of our approach to identify creative harmful memes.": 0.09039247035980225,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_33>>abstract>>Graph Neural Network (GNN) based social recommendation models improve the prediction accuracy of user preference by leveraging GNN in exploiting preference similarity contained in social relations. However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent capability of improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations.

However, the interaction signal may not be sufficient to accurately characterize user interests and the low-pass filters may ignore the useful information contained in the high-frequency component of the observed signals, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To this end, we propose a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design the personalized graph signal containing richer user information and construct an augmented similarity graph containing more graph topology information, to more effectively characterize user interests. Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful information in the high-frequency components of the observed signals by combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the personalized graph signal, the augmented similarity graph and the mixed-frequency graph filter by proposing a pipeline consisting of three key steps: pre-processing, graph convolution and post-processing. Extensive experiments show that PGSP can achieve superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art CF methods and, as a nonparametric method, PGSP has very high training efficiency.": 0.10839390754699707,

Based on these findings, we designed and conducted three large scale studies with remote crowdworker participants. Across the studies, we analyze over 14,000 trials from 590 participants who each viewed and answered questions about 28 diverse tables rendered in different formats.

Despite their decent performance, we argue one potential limitation of these methods — the embedding magnitude has not been explicitly modulated, which may aggravate popularity bias and training instability, hindering the model from making a good recommendation. It motivates us to leverage the embedding normalization in recommendation. By normalizing user/item embeddings to a specific value, we empirically observe impressive performance gains (9% on average) on four real-world datasets. Although encouraging, we also reveal a serious limitation when applying normalization in recommendation — the performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the temperature τ which controls the scale of the normalized embeddings.": 0.1297817826271057,

The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to generate multi-objective policies for four different psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal cases. We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses. Our system’s success in generating DIsorder-Specific Multi-Objective Policies (DISMOP) and interpretable policy dynamics demonstrates the potential of DRL in providing personalized and efficient therapeutic recommendations.": 0.10411584377288818,

Initialisation with historical data is an example of data-driven regularisation which should, in theory, accelerate the convergence of CMABs. However, in practice, we have little to no control over the underlying generation process of such data, which may exhibit some pathologies, possibly impeding the convergence and the stability of the algorithm. In this paper, we focus on two main challenges: bias selection and data corruption. We propose two new algorithms to solve these specific issues: LinUCB with historical data and offline balancing (OB-HLinUCB) and Robust LinUCB with corrupted historical data (R-HLinUCB).

Alternatively, she may choose to come back later and this long-term feedback is also modeled to promote user retention. However, the long-term feedback comes with non-trivial challenges in understanding user retention: the complicated correlation between current demands and follow-up demands, coupled with the periodicity of services. For instance, before the movie, the customer buys popcorn through the App, which temporally correlates with the initial movie recommendation. Days later, she checks the App for new movies, as a weekly routine. To address this complexity in a more fine-grained revisit modeling, we propose Time Aware Service Sequential Recommendation (TASSR) for user retention, which is equipped with a multi-task design and an In-category TimeSeqBlock module.

Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does not perform equally well for different user groups according to users’ sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to improve fairness. Given each real original user-item interaction record, we propose the following hypotheses for augmenting the training data: each user in one group has a similar item preference (click or non-click) as the item preference of any user in the remaining group. With these hypotheses, we generate “fake\" interaction behaviors to complement the original training data. After that, we design a bi-level optimization target, with the inner optimization generates better fake data to augment training data with our hypotheses, and the outer one updates the recommendation model parameters based on the augmented training data. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FDA.": 0.11451995372772217

Thanks to the rapid advances in reinforcement learning, it has offered an automated alternative, i.e. automated feature engineering (AutoFE). In this work, through scrutiny of the prior AutoFE methods, we characterize several research challenges that remained in this regime, concerning system-wide efficiency, efficacy, and practicality toward production. We then propose Catch, a full-fledged new AutoFE framework that comprehensively addresses the aforementioned challenges. The core to Catch composes a hierarchical-policy reinforcement learning scheme that manifests a collaborative feature engineering exploration and exploitation grounded on the granularity of the whole feature set. At a higher level of the hierarchy, a decision-making module controls the post-processing of the attained feature engineering transformation. We extensively experiment with Catch on 26 academic standardized tabular datasets and 9 industrialized real-world datasets.

Given a user query, the retrieval phase returns a subset of candidate products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image).

For each user request, a few of the microservices are called, and a trace is formed to record the tree-like call dependencies among microservices and the time consumption at each call node. Traces are useful in diagnosing system failures, but their complex structures make it difficult to model their patterns and detect their anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-variable graph variational autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection on microservice traces. To reconstruct the time consumption of nodes, we propose a novel dispatching layer. We find that the inversion of negative log-likelihood (NLL) appears for some anomalous samples, which makes the anomaly score infeasible for anomaly detection. To address this, we point out that the NLL can be decomposed into KL-divergence and data entropy, whereas lower-dimensional anomalies can introduce an entropy gap with normal inputs. We propose three techniques to mitigate this entropy gap for trace anomaly detection: Bernoulli & Categorical Scaling, Node Count Normalization, and Gaussian Std-Limit. On five trace datasets from a top Internet company, our proposed TraceVAE achieves excellent F-scores.": 0.11838001012802124,

To reduce the traffic overheads incurred by FL systems, edge servers have been included between clients and the parameter server to aggregate clients’ local models. Recent studies on this edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme have focused on ensuring or accelerating model convergence by coping with various factors, e.g., uncertain network conditions, unreliable clients, heterogeneous compute resources, etc. This paper presents our three new discoveries of the edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme: 1) it wastes significant time during its two-phase training rounds; 2) it does not recognize or utilize model diversity when producing a global model; and 3) it is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose FedEdge, a novel edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme that accelerates model training with asynchronous local federated training and adaptive model aggregation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used public datasets. The results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art FL schemes, FedEdge accelerates model convergence by 1.14 × −3.20 ×, and improves model accuracy by 2.14% - 6.63%.": 0.16229820251464844

It allows the cloud service provider to sell more resources than the physical limit, assuming not all users would fully utilize the resources simultaneously. However, how to design an oversubscription policy that improves utilization while satisfying some safety constraints remains an open problem. Existing methods and industrial practices are over-conservative, ignoring the coordination of diverse resource usage patterns and probabilistic constraints. To address these two limitations, this paper formulates the oversubscription for cloud as a chance-constrained optimization problem and proposes an effective Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (C2MARL) method to solve this problem. Specifically, C2MARL reduces the number of constraints by considering their upper bounds and leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm to learn a safe and optimal coordination policy. We evaluate our C2MARL on an internal cloud platform and public cloud datasets. Experiments show that our C2MARL outperforms existing methods in improving utilization () under different levels of safety constraints.": 0.13778507709503174

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_16>>abstract>>Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely used to enhance complex question answering (QA). To understand complex questions, existing studies employ language models (LMs) to encode contexts. Despite the simplicity, they neglect the latent relational information among question concepts and answers in KGs. While question concepts ubiquitously present hyponymy at the semantic level, e.g., mammals and animals, this feature is identically reflected in the hierarchical relations in KGs, e.g., a_type_of. Therefore, we are motivated to explore comprehensive reasoning by the hierarchical structures in KGs to help understand questions. However, it is non-trivial to reason over tree-like structures compared with chained paths. Moreover, identifying appropriate hierarchies relies on expertise. To this end, we propose HamQA, a novel Hierarchy-aware multi-hop Question Answering framework on knowledge graphs, to effectively align the mutual hierarchical information between question contexts and KGs. The entire learning is conducted in Hyperbolic space, inspired by its advantages of embedding hierarchical structures. Specifically, (i) we design a context-aware graph attentive network to capture context information. (ii) Hierarchical structures are continuously preserved in KGs by minimizing the Hyperbolic geodesic distances. The comprehensive reasoning is conducted to jointly train both components and provide a top-ranked candidate as an optimal answer. We achieve a higher ranking than the state-of-the-art multi-hop baselines on the official OpenBookQA leaderboard with an accuracy of 85%.": 0.11146378517150879

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_7>>abstract>>In the last few years, the solution to Knowledge Graph (KG) completion via learning embeddings of entities and relations has attracted a surge of interest. Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.": 0.11165773868560791,

Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM) is the task of finding useful patterns that statistically occur more often from databases for one class than for another. The existing SSPM task does not consider the weight of each item. While in the real world, the significant level of different items/objects is various. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Weighted Statistically Significant Patterns Mining (WSSPM) problem and propose a novel WSSpm algorithm to successfully solve it. We present a new framework that effectively mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. We also propose a new weighted support threshold that can satisfy the demand of WSSPM and prove its correctness and completeness. Besides, our weighted support threshold and modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range. Finally, experimental results on several real datasets show that the WSSpm algorithm performs well in terms of execution time and memory storage.": 0.09970664978027344,

Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect). The extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of computational complexity, number of parameters, and latency measures.": 0.12031286954879761,

The Metaverse, as a link between the real and virtual worlds, can provide users with immersive experiences. As the concept of the Metaverse grows in popularity, many scholars and developers begin to focus on the Metaverse’s ethics and core. This paper argues that the Metaverse should be centered on humans. That is, humans constitute the majority of the Metaverse. As a result, we begin this paper by introducing the Metaverse’s origins, characteristics, related technologies, and the concept of the human-centric Metaverse (HCM). Second, we discuss the manifestation of human-centric in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss some current issues in the construction of HCM. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the applications of human-centric technologies in the Metaverse, as well as the relevant HCM application scenarios. We hope that this paper can provide researchers and developers with some directions and ideas for human-centric Metaverse construction.": 0.10650628805160522

To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3.

We propose a novel approach to automatically determine the latitude-longitude coordinates of appropriate Wikipedia articles with high accuracy, leveraging both text and metadata in the corpus. By examining articles whose base-truth coordinates are known, we show that our method attains a substantial improvement over state of the art works. We subsequently demonstrate how our approach could yield two benefits: (1) detecting significant geolocation errors in Wikipedia; and (2) proposing approximated coordinates for hundreds of thousands of articles which are not traditionally considered to be locations (such as events, ideas or people), opening new possibilities for conceptual geographic retrievals over Wikipedia.": 0.1558714509010315

This abundance of human interaction makes SM particularly attractive for social sensing. Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums, users post information and encourage others to support their side, using symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless, the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals’ stances. We analyze users’ attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines.": 0.1023293137550354,

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the situations that arouse out of the pandemic were so incongruous to the world we knew that even factual statements often had a humorous reaction. In this paper, we present a dataset of 2510 samples hand-annotated with labels such as humor style, type, theme, target and stereotypes formed or exploited while creating the humor in addition to 909 memes. Our dataset comprises Reddit posts, comments, Onion news headlines, real news headlines, and tweets. We evaluate the task of humor detection and maladaptive humor detection on state-of-the-art models namely RoBERTa and GPT-3. The finetuned models trained on our dataset show significant gains over zero-shot models including GPT-3 when detecting humor. Even though GPT-3 is good at generating meaningful explanations, we observed that it fails to detect maladaptive humor due to the absence of overt targets and profanities. We believe that the presented dataset will be helpful in designing computational methods for topical humor processing as it provides a unique sample set to study the theory of incongruity in a post-pandemic world.

The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. Instead, we approach this problem using semi-supervised learning with a large language model (LLM). Our pipeline generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation.": 0.12862789630889893

One such structure, the Ego Network Model (ENM), has been found almost ubiquitously in human society. Recently, this model has been extended to include signed connections. While the unsigned ENM has been rigorously observed for decades, the signed version is still somewhat novel and lacks the same breadth of observation. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to examine this signed structure across various categories of individuals from a swathe of culturally distinct regions. Minor differences in the distribution of signs across the SENM can be observed between cultures. However, these can be overwhelmed when the network is centred around a specific topic. Indeed, users who are engaged with specific themes display higher levels of negativity in their networks. This effect is further supported by a significant negative correlation between the number of \"general\" topics discussed in a network and that network’s percentage of negative connections. These findings suggest that the negativity of communications and relationships on Twitter are very dependent on the topics being discussed and, furthermore, these relationships are more likely to be negative when they are based around a specific topic.": 0.15167969465255737

To gain insight into public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines, survey studies and the analysis of social media platforms have been conducted. However, existing methods lack consideration of individual vaccination intentions or status and the relationship between public perceptions and actual vaccine uptake. To address these limitations, this study proposes a text classification approach to identify tweets indicating a user’s intent or status on vaccination. A comparative analysis between the proportions of tweets from different categories and real-world vaccination data reveals notable alignment, suggesting that tweets may serve as a precursor to actual vaccination status. Further, regression analysis and time series forecasting were performed to explore the potential of tweet data, demonstrating the significance of incorporating tweet data in predicting future vaccination status. Finally, clustering was applied to the tweet sets with positive and negative labels to gain insights into underlying focuses of each stance.": 0.16471004486083984

To build this tool, we first construct an extensive collection of WebAssembly samples that represent the state of WebAssembly. Second, we analyze the dataset and identify the diverse use cases of the collected WebAssembly modules. We leverage the dataset of WebAssembly modules to construct semantics-aware intermediate representations (IR) of the functions in the modules. We encode the function IR for use in a machine learning classifier, and we find that this classifier can predict the similarity of a given function against known named functions with an accuracy rate of 88.07%.

Secondly, we establish a principled perspective of pre-trained embeddings via the lens of kernel analysis, which can be used to evaluate their predictability, interactively and scalably. These findings help to address the practical challenges we faced and offer valuable guidance for successful adoption of pretrained embeddings in real-world production.

One such problem faced by e-commerce platforms is Return To Origin (RTO), where the user cancels an order while it is in transit for delivery. In such a scenario platform faces logistics and opportunity costs. Traditionally, models trained on historical trends are used to predict the propensity of an order becoming RTO. Sociology literature has highlighted clear correlations between socio-economic indicators and users’ tendency to exploit systems to gain financial advantage. Social media profiles have information about location, education, and profession which have been shown to be an estimator of socio-economic condition. We believe combining social media data with e-commerce information can lead to improvements in a variety of tasks like RTO, recommendation, fraud detection, and credit modeling. In our proposed system, we find the public social profile of an e-commerce user and extract socio-economic features. Internal data fused with extracted social features are used to train a RTO order detection model. Our system demonstrates a performance improvement in RTO detection of 3.1% and 19.9% on precision and recall, respectively. Our system directly impacts the bottom line revenue and shows the applicability of social re-identification in e-commerce.": 0.14414966106414795

To ensure consistent model performance and account for variations in data distribution, regular retraining is necessary. This paper introduces a solution for improving online customer service in e-commerce by presenting a universal model for predicting labels based on customer questions, without requiring training. Our novel approach involves using machine learning techniques to tag customer questions in transcripts and create a repository of questions and corresponding labels.

A typical approach collects nodes relevant to the QA pair from a KG to form a Working Graph (WG) followed by reasoning using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This faces two major challenges: (i) it is difficult to capture all the information from the QA in the WG, and (ii) the WG contains some irrelevant nodes from the KG. To address these, we propose GrapeQA with two simple improvements on the WG: (i) Prominent Entities for Graph Augmentation identifies relevant text chunks from the QA pair and augments the WG with corresponding latent representations from the LM, and (ii) Context-Aware Node Pruning removes nodes that are less relevant to the QA pair. We evaluate our results on OpenBookQA, CommonsenseQA and MedQA-USMLE and see that GrapeQA shows consistent improvements over its LM + KG predecessor (QA-GNN in particular) and large improvements on OpenBookQA.": 0.15166187286376953

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution to improve seasonal relevance in product search by incorporating seasonality into language models for semantic matching. We first identify seasonal queries and products by analyzing implicit seasonal contexts through time-series analysis over the past year. Then we introduce explicit seasonal contexts by enhancing the query representation with a season token according to when the query is issued. A new season-enhanced BERT model (SE-BERT) is also proposed to learn the semantic similarity between the resulting seasonal queries and products. SE-BERT utilizes Multi-modal Adaption Gate (MAG) to augment the season-enhanced semantic embedding with other contextual information such as product price and review counts for robust relevance prediction. To better align with the ranking objective, a listwise loss function (neural NDCG) is used to regularize learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms existing solutions for query-product relevance prediction in terms of NDCG and Price Weighted Purchases (PWP).": 0.10894447565078735

A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding. The performance of these detection algorithms can be taken as a baseline for future research on detecting malicious bidding.": 0.14955776929855347

Concretely, at each time t, the learner receives a context and decides the bid based on historical information and xt. We assume that the maximum bid of all the others follows a linear model, i.e., mt = ⟨α0, xt⟩ + zt, where is unknown to the learner and zt is randomly sampled from a noise distribution with log-concave density. In this work, we consider both binary feedback (the learner can only observe whether she wins or not) and full information feedback (the learner can observe mt) models of the learner. For binary feedback, when the noise distribution is (partially) known, we propose a bidding algorithm that achieves at most regret, where Δ is a constant reserve in first price auctions.1 For the full information feedback with unknown noise distribution, we provide an algorithm that achieves regret at most . Our approach combines an estimator for log-concave density functions and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to learn the noise distribution and linear weight α0 simultaneously. We complement our results with a lower bound result such that any bidding policy in a broad class must achieve regret at least , even when the learner receives the full information feedback and is known.": 0.1169319748878479,

However, existing detection methods in the audio area exclusively work in English, and there is a lack of data resources in other languages. Cross-lingual deepfake detection, a critical but rarely explored area, urges more study. This paper conducts the first comprehensive study on the cross-lingual perspective of deepfake detection. We observe that English data enriched in deepfake algorithms can teach a detector the knowledge of various spoofing artifacts, contributing to performing detection across language domains. Based on the observation, we first construct a first-of-its-kind cross-lingual evaluation dataset including heterogeneous spoofed speech uttered in the two most widely spoken languages, then explored domain adaptation (DA) techniques to transfer the artifacts detection capability and propose effective and practical DA strategies fitting the cross-lingual scenario. Our adversarial-based DA paradigm teaches the model to learn real/fake knowledge while losing language dependency. Extensive experiments over 137-hour audio clips validate the adapted models can detect fake audio generated by unseen algorithms in the new domain.": 0.11807382106781006,

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.": 0.11345559358596802,

Generally, healthcare consumers use long and detailed questions with several peripheral details to express their healthcare concerns, contributing to natural language understanding challenges. One way to address this challenge is by summarizing the questions. However, most of the existing abstractive summarization systems generate impeccably fluent yet factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary. Our extensive experimental results on two benchmark consumer health question summarization datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method by achieving state-of-the-art performance and generating factually correct and fluent summaries, as measured by human evaluation.": 0.13482391834259033

This loosely refers to a mix of decentralized technologies, often underpinned by blockchain technologies. Among these, Web3 social media platforms have begun to emerge. These store all social interaction data (e.g., posts) on a public ledger, removing the need for centralized data ownership and management. But this comes at a cost, which some argue is prohibitively expensive. As an exemplar within this growing ecosytem, we explore memo.cash, a microblogging service built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. We gather data for 24K users, 317K posts, 2.57M user actions, which have facilitated $6.75M worth of transactions. A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.": 0.17014986276626587

Existing paradigms of workload forecasting (i.e., edge-only or cloud-only) are improper, due to failing to consider the inter-site correlations and might suffer from significant data transmission delays. With the increasing adoption of edge platforms by web services, it is critical to balance both accuracy and efficiency in workload forecasting. In this paper, we propose ELASTIC, which is the first study that leverages a cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for edge workload forecasting with multi-view graphs. Specifically, at the global stage, we design a learnable aggregation layer on each edge site to reduce the time consumption while capturing the inter-site correlation. Additionally, at the local stage, we design a disaggregation layer combining both the intra-site correlation and inter-site correlation to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on realistic edge workload datasets collected from China’s largest edge service provider show that ELASTIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, decreases time consumption, and reduces communication cost.": 0.11628454923629761

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_33>>abstract>>With the development of recommender systems, it becomes an increasingly common need to mix multiple item sequences from different sources. Therefore, the integrated ranking stage is proposed to be responsible for this task with re-ranking models. However, existing methods ignore the relation between the sequences, thus resulting in local optimum over the interaction session. To resolve this challenge, in this paper, we propose a new model named NFIRank (News Feed Integrated Ranking with reinforcement learning) and formulate the whole interaction session as a MDP (Markov Decision Process). Sufficient offline experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of our model. In addition, we deployed our model on Huawei Browser and gained 1.58% improvements in CTR compared with the baseline in online A/B test. Code will be available at https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/research/recommend/NFIRank.": 0.15899181365966797,

According to the explorer, we find that more than 75% of slashable Byzantine actions were not slashed. Since Ethereum relies on the “stake-and-slash\" mechanism to align incentives, this finding would at its face value cause concern over Ethereum’s security. However, further investigation reveals that all the apparent unslashed incidents were erroneously recorded due to the explorer’s mishandling of consensus edge cases.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving.

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment.

Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.": 0.12380421161651611,

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing. Finally, crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.": 0.16039347648620605,

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week_5>>abstract>>Organisations have to comply with environmental regulations to protect the environment and meet internationally agreed climate change targets. To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential.": 0.13010859489440918

However, previous attempts at heterogeneous micro task assignment based on worker characteristics are limited to using cognitive skills, despite literature emphasising that worker performance varies based on other parameters. This study is an initial step towards understanding whether and how multiple parameters such as cognitive skills, mood, personality, alertness, comprehension skill, and social and physical context of workers can be leveraged in tandem to improve worker performance estimations in heterogeneous micro tasks. Our predictive models indicate that these parameters have varying effects on worker performance in the five task types considered – sentiment analysis, classification, transcription, named entity recognition and bounding box. Moreover, we note 0.003 - 0.018 reduction in mean absolute error of predicted worker accuracy across all tasks, when task assignment is based on models that consider all parameters vs. models that only consider workers’ cognitive skills. Our findings pave the way for the use of holistic approaches in micro task assignment that effectively quantify worker context.": 0.14073920249938965,

In short, given a cold-start song request, we expect to retrieve songs with similar audiences and then fastly push the cold-start song to the audiences of the retrieved songs to warm up it. However, there are hardly any studies done on this task. Therefore, in this paper, we will formalize the problem of Music Cold-Start Matching detailedly and give a scheme. During the offline training, we attempt to learn high-quality song representations based on song content features. But, we find supervision signals typically follow power-law distribution causing skewed representation learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning paradigm named Bootstrapping Contrastive Learning (BCL) to enhance the quality of learned representations by exerting contrastive regularization. During the online serving, to locate the target audiences more accurately, we propose Clustering-based Audience Targeting (CAT) that clusters audience representations to acquire a few cluster centroids and then locate the target audiences by measuring the relevance between the audience representations and the cluster centroids. Extensive experiments on the offline dataset and online system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Currently, we have deployed it on NetEase Cloud Music, affecting millions of users.": 0.26829200983047485,

While most prior work in this area focuses on node-level representation, limited research has been conducted on graph-level embedding, particularly for dynamic or temporal networks. However, learning low-dimensional graph-level representations for dynamic networks is critical for various downstream graph retrieval tasks such as temporal graph similarity ranking, temporal graph isomorphism, and anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a novel method for temporal graph-level embedding that addresses this gap. Our approach involves constructing a multilayer graph and using a modified random walk with temporal backtracking to generate temporal contexts for the graph’s nodes. We then train a “document-level’’ language model on these contexts to generate graph-level embeddings. We evaluate our proposed model on five publicly available datasets for the task of temporal graph similarity ranking, and our model outperforms baseline methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating graph-level embeddings for dynamic networks.": 0.16418063640594482

These KGs can be used as the basis for dataset search engines, saving researchers time and supporting them in finding new connections. We collected textual data and used several modern natural language processing (NLP) methods to create the nodes and the edges of the KGs.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_10>>abstract>>The wide popularity of short videos on social media poses new opportunities and challenges to optimize recommender systems on the video-sharing platforms. Users sequentially interact with the system and provide complex and multi-faceted responses, including WatchTime  and various types of interactions with multiple videos. On the one hand, the platforms aim at optimizing the users’ cumulative WatchTime  (main goal) in the long term, which can be effectively optimized by Reinforcement Learning. On the other hand, the platforms also need to satisfy the constraint of accommodating the responses of multiple user interactions (auxiliary goals) such as Like, Follow, Share, etc. In this paper, we formulate the problem of short video recommendation as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We find that traditional constrained reinforcement learning algorithms fail to work well in this setting. We propose a novel two-stage constrained actor-critic method: At stage one, we learn individual policies to optimize each auxiliary signal. In stage two, we learn a policy to (i) optimize the main signal and (ii) stay close to policies learned in the first stage, which effectively guarantees the performance of this main policy on the auxiliaries. Through extensive offline evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over alternatives in both optimizing the main goal as well as balancing the others. We further show the advantage of our method in live experiments of short video recommendations, where it significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of both WatchTime  and interactions. Our approach has been fully launched in the production system to optimize user experiences on the platform.": 0.19976311922073364
