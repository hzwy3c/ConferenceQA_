The conference will take place online, hosted at Austin, USA, on April 30 - May 4, 2023.\nThe Web has proven to be a fertile ground for industrial research, and companies from small to large, from brand new to long established, are making an ongoing impact on the state of the art in science and engineering. The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library. Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>TheWebConf 2023 Research Tracks Final Call For Papers (CFP) 'Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility'>>Instructions for authors of research tracks submissions>>IndustrialEnvironment>>description>>If your paper is based on results obtained in an industrial environment, has clear industry relevance, addresses challenges motivated by practical settings, and has been deployed or released, you may want to check the Industry Track(https://www2023.thewebconf.org/calls/industry/).\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Call For Workshops Proposals>>Organizational Details for Workshops>>The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own review process and publicity. They must maintain an up-to-date website for their workshop that will be referenced from The Web Conference 2023 website. They are required to cooperate closely with the conference workshop chairs and with the local organizers to finalize all details and to provide input for publicity. Accepted workshops will be scheduled so as to avoid conflicts with conference sessions in similar or related areas.\nWorkshops will benefit from the registration process of The Web Conference 2023. Workshop organizers must inform the Workshop Chairs of the numbers of submissions and acceptances as these numbers become available. Workshops with fewer than 15 expected registrants may be cancelled or merged with other workshops at the discretion of the conference organizers and will not be part of the official/accepted conference workshops. The cancelled workshops will not enjoy the support mentioned above. Workshop timelines (deadlines for submissions, notification, and camera-ready papers) are proposed by the workshop organizers in agreement with The Web Conference 2023 workshop chairs.\nThe workshop organization shall follow the same guidelines as the main conference in terms of physical presence. At least one organizer should be physically present and the authors of workshop papers should be encouraged to attend the Web Conference 2023 in person.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Web Developer and W3C>>Submissions guidelines>>Submissions can take several form and authors can choose one or multiple submission entry among the following choices:\nPapers: papers are limited to 6 pages, including references.

Workshop papers that have been previously published or are under review for another journal, conference or workshop should not be considered for publication. Workshop papers should not exceed 12 pages in length (maximum 8 pages for the main paper content + maximum 2 pages for appendixes + maximum 2 pages for references). Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to the ACM template published in the ACM guidelines(https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Workshop papers must be self-contained and in English.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Call For Workshops Proposals>>Organizational Details for Workshops>>The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own review process and publicity. They must maintain an up-to-date website for their workshop that will be referenced from The Web Conference 2023 website. They are required to cooperate closely with the conference workshop chairs and with the local organizers to finalize all details and to provide input for publicity. Accepted workshops will be scheduled so as to avoid conflicts with conference sessions in similar or related areas.\nWorkshops will benefit from the registration process of The Web Conference 2023. Workshop organizers must inform the Workshop Chairs of the numbers of submissions and acceptances as these numbers become available. Workshops with fewer than 15 expected registrants may be cancelled or merged with other workshops at the discretion of the conference organizers and will not be part of the official/accepted conference workshops. The cancelled workshops will not enjoy the support mentioned above. Workshop timelines (deadlines for submissions, notification, and camera-ready papers) are proposed by the workshop organizers in agreement with The Web Conference 2023 workshop chairs.\nThe workshop organization shall follow the same guidelines as the main conference in terms of physical presence. At least one organizer should be physically present and the authors of workshop papers should be encouraged to attend the Web Conference 2023 in person.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Call For Workshops Proposals>>Track name>>Workshops\n\nQuestion:How many workshops are there in this conference?\nAnswer:", "gt": "There are 21 workshops in this conference.", "response": "<pad> 20"}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "Are there any tutorials related to graph neural network(GNN) in this conference?

In classic auction theory, only the auctioneer (i.e., the platform) and buyers (i.e., the advertisers) are involved, while the advertising audiences are ignored. For ecommerce advertising, however, the platform can provide coupons for the advertising audiences and nudge them into purchasing more products at lower prices (e.g., 2 dollars off the regular price).

In this paper, we jointly design the coupon value computation, slot allocation, and payment of online advertising in an auto-bidding world. Firstly, we propose the auction mechanism, named CFA-auction (i.e., Coupon-For-the-Audiences-auction), which takes advertising audiences into account in the auction design. We prove the existence of pacing equilibrium, and show that CFA-auction satisfies the IC (incentive compatibility), IR (individual rationality) constraints. Then, we study the optimality of CFA-auction, and prove it can maintain an approximation of the optimal.
