In the multi-task setting where each agent is asked multiple questions, a sequence of mechanisms have been proposed which are truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be an equilibrium, or even better, informed truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be one of the best-paid equilibria. However, these guarantees assume agents’ strategies are restricted to be task-independent: an agent’s report on a task is not affected by her information about other tasks.": 0.14930182695388794, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_3>>abstract>>In conference peer review, reviewers are often asked to provide “bids” on each submitted paper that express their interest in reviewing that paper. A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding. The performance of these detection algorithms can be taken as a baseline for future research on detecting malicious bidding.": 0.14954525232315063}, "What is the main theme of the Web Sci2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Paper Sessions>>desciption>>https://websci23.webscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-27-at-17.17.33-1024x636.png": 0.11413168907165527, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>description>>description_4>>https://websci23.webscience.org/": 0.11479461193084717, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_2>>The architecture and philosophy of the Web": 0.11854100227355957, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_3>>Automation and AI in all its manifestations relevant to the Web": 0.11927610635757446, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Making the Web Inclusive>>Making the Web Inclusive_4>>Safeguarding and governance of the Web, including anonymity, security and trust": 0.11998516321182251, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>About the Web Science Conference>>Web Science is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding the complex and multiple impacts of the Web on society and vice versa.
