It has become one of the hottest topics in the machine learning community due to its ability to develop better AI systems that respect users' privacy and the legitimate interests of private companies. As described in the papers, federated learning is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm designed for a large number of edge devices. It provides a solution for data privacy and data leakage issues. Looking into the future, applying federated learning in metaverse technologies (FL4M) holds unlimited potential. This method not only offers a high level of data privacy but also reduces the demand for high computational power from servers. Therefore, it's viewed as a promising research direction with potential to aid in building a fair, open, and secure metaverse."

Traditional methods of meme analysis suffer from data deficiency and a semantic gap using conventional pretrained encoders, leading to low effectiveness. To address these issues, the paper presents a prompt-based method which transforms multimodal data into a single, textual modality by generating captions and attributes of the visual data. This method then uses the textual data in a prompt-based pre-trained language model. The paper reports that experimental results show this method outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in the identification of harmful memes."
