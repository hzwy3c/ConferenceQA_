Initially, Program Committee (PC) members self-declare their expertise for each paper. Each submission subsequently receives at least three independent reviews within each respective track. The paper is then discussed between PC members, the assigned SPC, and track chairs, both pre- and post-rebuttal. Following these discussions, the papers are ranked on a variety of factors, including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics. Based on these rankings, track chairs recommend papers for presentation at the conference, for inclusion in the proceedings, and for awards. For the PhD Symposium, all submissions are reviewed by the Program Committee, who are experienced researchers in relevant areas."}]
