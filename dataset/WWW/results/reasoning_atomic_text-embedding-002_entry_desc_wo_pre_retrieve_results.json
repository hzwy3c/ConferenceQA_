The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library.
