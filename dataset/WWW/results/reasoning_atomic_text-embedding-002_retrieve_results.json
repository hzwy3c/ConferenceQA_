The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau. The International World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2) was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW became an annual event held in late April or early May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.": 0.11493909358978271, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_5>>subsessions>>subsessions_2>>subsession>>7621-Dynamic Interventions for Networked Contagions": 0.11919671297073364, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_33>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3584653": 0.12086725234985352, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Wed May 03>>Wed May 03_22>>subsessions>>subsessions_7>>time>>2:40 PM – 2:50 PM": 0.1210712194442749, "WWW2023>>Program>>Program Overview>>Sunday April 30>>Sunday April 30_8>>event>>Knowledge Graph Day": 0.12240201234817505, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Mon May 01>>Mon May 01_20>>Subsessions>>Subsessions_1>>time>>9:30 AM – 10:30 AM": 0.12318229675292969, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_12>>organizers>>organizers_4>>Sarah Dean": 0.123390793800354}, "Can I attend the conference remotely?": {"WWW2023>>Attendees>>Virtual Participation Award>>The ACM SIGWEB Fair Access Virtual Participation Awards -

To crack the code, you need to crack the culture that makes us who we are. Who and what is creative remains largely disconnected from diverse and global cultural norms, rendering existing technology suboptimal and even unusable to the world’s majority. Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation.

Throughout my work, I’ve come to appreciate how social media has democratized access to real-world news and social sentiment, while also witnessing the loss of trust created by fake information. As a computer scientist from Chile in Latin America, I have worked on a range of problems that were driven by local needs. Many times, I have tried to apply state of the art solutions to well-known problems, only to find that these don’t work outside of their initial evaluation dataset. In this talk, I’ll discuss how geographical, language, and social diversity have opened new avenues for innovation and better understanding the social Web.
