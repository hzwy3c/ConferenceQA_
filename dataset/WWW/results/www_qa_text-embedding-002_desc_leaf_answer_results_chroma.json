        "output": "The paper 'A Decentralised Persistent Identification Layer for DCAT Datasets' proposes a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a virtually centralized directory. To support this architecture, they propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). They have implemented their approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric."

        "output": "The research addresses the issue of online misinformation by proposing a method to detect 'fauxtography', a type of online misinformation where the image and associated text in a social media post together convey questionable or false information. The method, called ContrastFaux, is a multi-view contrastive learning framework that works by exploring the sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multimodal posts. Despite the scarcity of annotated data, ContrastFaux manages to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. It manages to overcome the limitations of current fauxtography detection approaches that often require a large amount of expensive and inefficient manual annotations. Evaluation results showed that ContrastFaux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning fauxtography detection baselines by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy."

First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale."

This model uses a knowledge graph to model urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces. A cross-modality based contrastive learning framework is then designed with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. This model reportedly shows superior performance in terms of socioeconomic prediction using urban imagery, with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines."

This tool can help in identifying outliers that could potentially be engaged in malicious activities according to financial regulations. The authors identify a set of network metrics that provide insights on individual nodes. By tracking the evolution over time of metric-based node rankings, they can highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that would require further attention by AFC officers. These changes may not be easily noticed by current AFC practices that may lack a global vision of the system."

To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system."

However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. The code and data are released in https://github.com/liu-yang-maker/Curvature-based-Dropout."

Their method involves transforming multimodal data to a single textual modality by generating captions and attributes of visual data and then incorporating this textual data in a prompt-based pre-trained language model. The study found their method to be effective, outperforming previous approaches, and demonstrating transferability and robustness for identifying creative harmful memes."

The denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Additionally, to avoid interference from noisy social relations, a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy are designed, both favoring highly-confident samples.\n\nThe significance of the paper lies in its approach to address the problem of relation redundancy and noise in social recommendation models, which has not been fully solved by existing models. The proposed method demonstrates its potential by consistently improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations according to experimental results on three public datasets."

However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations. Through multimodal interaction, we aim to encourage innovation on the Web and create more visually appealing and engaging virtual displays. It is hoped that the greater online art community will gain fresh insight into how people interact with virtual worlds as a result of this work."

This approach introduces a new framework that mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. It also includes a new weighted support threshold that satisfies the demands of WSSPM, with proofs provided for its correctness and completeness. The weighted support threshold and the modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range."

This model is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. The model works by meta-training a GNN framework that captures the relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations, which allows the learned embeddings of patterns to be transferred to embed unseen components. The research found that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines."

A critical aspect is a presumption that the peak bid from all other participants follows a linear model, mixed with some random noise from a log-concave density distribution. The study introduces a bidding algorithm for cases where the noise distribution is partially known and provides one for scenarios where it's unknown. Both algorithms are designed to minimize regret and leverage elements like the Maximum Likelihood Estimation to learn and adapt to the noise distribution and linear weight. The results indicate that even with full feedback and known parameters, any bidding policy will still have some level of regret."

It uses time-regime clustering, a temporal clustering method that clusters the historical evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. The ISVM, incorporated within periods driven by investor sentiment by using implied volatility data, helps in adapting option pricing models to sudden jumps in higher order characteristics. \n\nThis integrated approach, MR-ISVM, is tested on high-frequency data on BTC options, aiding in pricing the market based on its participants' expectations in an adaptive manner. It reduces the complexity required to employ traditional theories or trying to fit historical patterns that might not repeat, thus addressing unique market dynamics of DAs."

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems."

        "output": "The abstract of the paper titled 'Implementing an Environmental Management System Using Provenance-By-Design' discusses how organisations need to comply with environmental regulations to meet international climate change targets. Processes and standards are defined to manage these compliance obligations which rely on the concept of Environmental Management System (EMS). An EMS framework contains a record of evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. The maintenance of an EMS is typically human-driven and can be prone to errors. To counteract this, there is a need for trusted automated means to check these claims. This paper investigates the advantages of provenance for EMS and introduces an emerging approach - “Provenance-By-Design”. It automatically converts an EMS data model specification and its provenance to a data backend and a series of tools that include a service for processing and querying EMS provenance data, a client-side library that interacts with the service, and a user interface for developers to navigate through the provenance. The paper concludes by reflecting on the potential novel opportunities presented by applying a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications."

He is best known for co-inventing Ethernet, founding 3Com and formulating Metcalfe's Law. \n\nHe studied Electrical Engineering at MIT and received a Bachelor's degree in 1969. He later completed a Masters in Applied Mathematics and a Ph.D in Computer Science at Harvard University. \n\nIn 1972, Metcalfe joined the research staff at Xerox PARC, where he, along with David Boggs, invented Ethernet, a technology for connecting computers over short distances.\n\nIn 1979, Metcalfe left Xerox to found 3Com, a manufacturer of Ethernet devices and later a major networking company. Under his leadership, 3Com commercialized Ethernet and grew into a billion-dollar company. \n\nIn addition to his entrepreneurial and technical achievements, Metcalfe has had a significant impact on the tech industry through his work as a venture capitalist and as a columnist for InfoWorld, where he formulated Metcalfe's Law, which states that the value of a network increases in proportion to the square of the number of its users.\n\nDespite these achievements, it's important to highlight that I don't have information that Bob Metcalfe gave the ACM A.M. Turing Award Lecture. The ACM A.M. Turing Award is considered the \"Nobel Prize of Computing\" and is given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to an individual or individuals who made substantial contributions of lasting importance to computing."
