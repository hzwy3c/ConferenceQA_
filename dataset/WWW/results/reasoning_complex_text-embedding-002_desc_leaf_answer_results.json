It includes discussion on how repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information regardless of its actual veracity. The talk also includes the concept of a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media.

First, the papers should adhere to the ACM template and format, and must be self-contained and written in English. For short papers, they should be up to 5 pages, inclusive of references, appendices, etc. These short papers usually report on high-quality ongoing work that is not mature enough for a full-length publication. Once the papers are submitted, they will be judged by the Program Committee upon rigorous peer review standards for quality and fit for the conference, by at least three referees. Each paper will also be assigned to a Senior Program Committee member to ensure review quality. Furthermore, Program Committee members will self-declare their expertise for each paper, and each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track."}]
