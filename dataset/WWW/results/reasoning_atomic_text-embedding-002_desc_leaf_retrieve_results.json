The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library.

To crack the code, you need to crack the culture that makes us who we are. Who and what is creative remains largely disconnected from diverse and global cultural norms, rendering existing technology suboptimal and even unusable to the world’s majority. Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation. This talk discusses concerns around digital labor, data materiality, media literacies, creative value, and online expression. In doing so, it sets a pathway towards designing inclusive and intersectional systems that transcend borders.": 0.08222991228103638, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_4>>speaker>>Payal Arora": 0.0931236743927002, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_4>>speaker_affiliation>>Cofounder Femlab": 0.11001193523406982}, "Which event has a best paper award announced?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_2>>The annual best paper award": 0.1306462287902832, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_2>>Yu-Ru Lin, University of Pittsburgh": 0.13297319412231445, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_1>>Yelena Mejova, ISI Foundation, Turin (Chair)": 0.14138025045394897, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_3>>Kristina Lerman, University of South California": 0.14382147789001465, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_1>>This year we will be allocating two awards:": 0.1447213888168335, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_252>>authors>>authors_2>>Justin Cheng and Robert West": 0.1460217833518982, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_364>>authors>>authors_2>>Lei Han": 0.1462113857269287, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_4>>These awards are kindly sponsored by the Web Science Trust.": 0.14669960737228394, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_75>>authors>>authors_3>>Dongha Lee": 0.14758414030075073, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_102>>authors>>authors_5>>Sheng Zhou and Xiangnan He": 0.14898324012756348, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_59>>authors>>authors_1>>Mengmei Zhang": 0.1509532332420349, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_157>>authors>>authors_3>>Dan Finnie": 0.1514989137649536, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_145>>authors>>authors_1>>Yuan Gao": 0.15263861417770386, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_260>>authors>>authors_1>>Sergej Wildemann": 0.1527422070503235}, "What is the role of the peer prediction mechanism in a crowdsourcing setting?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_3>>abstract>>Peer prediction aims to incentivize truthful reports from agents whose reports cannot be assessed with any objective ground truthful information. In the multi-task setting where each agent is asked multiple questions, a sequence of mechanisms have been proposed which are truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be an equilibrium, or even better, informed truthful — truth-telling is guaranteed to be one of the best-paid equilibria.
