        "query": "What is the challenge faced by customer searches for movie and series titles in non-English speaking countries?",
        "output": "The challenge faced by customer searches for movie and series titles in non-English speaking countries is that the regional titles are transliterated from the native language to English, which can result in multiple possible transliterations for almost all titles. This can make searching for a regional title very frustrating if the search system does not handle these nuances correctly. The problem is further complicated by typing errors. Streaming services try to address this issue with spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features, but these can fail or have limited success due to a lack of strict grammar rules and constant additions of new titles to the catalog."

This is due to the fact that a conversational search session is much longer and contains many noisy tokens compared to traditional single-turn ad-hoc search. The paper also mentions existing conversational dense retrieval solutions, which simply fine-tune the pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder on limited conversation search data, often fail to achieve satisfactory performance in such complex conversational search cases. These solutions also lack interpretability, meaning it's hard to determine how the model understands the session. To resolve these issues, the paper proposes a sparse Lexical-based Conversational REtriever (LeCoRE).\n"

        "output": "The approach described in 'Intent-Aware Propensity Estimation via Click Pattern Stratification' involves a method that modifies the current click propensity model, which is based on position bias. This new approach proposes an observation model that further incorporates the underlying search intent, as reflected in the user’s click pattern in the search context. It does not require an intent prediction model based on the content of the search context, but rather relies on a non-causal estimate of the user’s browsing intent from the number of click events in the search context. The method characterizes distinct rank decay patterns of the estimated click propensities in the identified intent classes, displaying a sharper decay of click propensities in top ranks for the intent class identified by sparse user clicks, and a higher likelihood of observing clicks in lower ranks for the intent class identified by a higher number of user clicks. This intent-aware propensity estimation technique is found to be useful in training ranking models with better personalization and generalization power."

They focus on a sparse semi-supervised fauxtography detection problem, which aims to identify fauxtography using sparsely annotated ground truth labels of social media posts. To solve the problem, they propose a framework known as ContrastFaux. This multi-view contrastive learning framework uses sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multi-modal posts to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. This approach aims to overcome the challenges with current fauxtography detection methods that often require a large number of expensive and inefficient manual annotations. The study found that ContrastFaux outperforms other state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning detection models by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy."

However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. The code and data are released in https://github.com/liu-yang-maker/Curvature-based-Dropout."

Sentences with similar semantics, despite different wordings, have similar representations in AMR. To apply this for timeline summarization, they propose a two-step sentence selection method that utilizes features extracted from both AMRs and the text. The first step generates AMRs for each sentence and filters out sentences with no named-entities, keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. The second step selects sentences for the timeline based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes and the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text. The proposed approach's potential is demonstrated through experimental results on the TLS-Covid19 test collection."

These memes can carry misleading, manipulative and controversial content ranging from hate speech to causing emotional distress. Due to data deficiency, current analyses suffer from insufficient learning. Further, conventional pretrained encoders for text and images lead to a semantic gap in feature spaces, resulting in low performance. To address these gaps, the paper proposes a prompt-based approach for harmful meme analysis, which converts multimodal data into a single textual modality, using a pre-trained language model. The method demonstrated better performance with two benchmark harmful memes datasets, proving both its transferability and robustness."

This method, referred to as graph denoising, is designed to deal with redundancy and noise in social relations that can negatively impact recommendation efficiency and effectiveness. The denoising method is guided by user preference and benefits user preference learning by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models.\n\nThe significance of the paper lies in its potential to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of social recommendation models. The proposed method incorporates a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy that favor high-confidence samples. As a result, the model can robustly remove 10-40% of original relations, consequently improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models as demonstrated by experimental results. The authors have shared the source code for the method, which can contribute to further scholarly work and real-world applications in social recommendation."

The framework is designed to be independent of financial features, and focuses on learning dense representations of the image and text data to perform a price-category classification task. It also has the ability to be tuned according to user preferences in the inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles. The aim is to foster profitable investments and outperform baseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features."

This method is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from existing TKGs and tested in emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. It uses a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations, allowing the learned embeddings to be transferred to embed unseen components. The paper shows that this new method outperforms existing models for knowledge graph extrapolation."

The paper proposes a new attack method along with a list-assisted defense mechanism. It further enhances the defense mechanism with a traffic splitting feature to achieve a balance between defense and network overhead. The effectiveness of these proposed algorithms is tested on real traffic patterns collected from three mainstream browsers - Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox."

Existing models have shortcomings as they either add complexity or overfit historical patterns. However, the new method, termed MR-ISVM, leverages recent advances in market regime clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM). This model clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods, taking into account the non-stationarity, and is able to incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods using implied volatility data. The MR-ISVM model helps to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models, which allows pricing the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion. This approach has been successfully applied to high-frequency data on Bitcoin options, providing insights into previously unexplored DA dynamics."

        "output": "Prior work on explaining missing (unexpected) query results identifies which parts of the query or data are responsible for the erroneous result or repairs the query or data to fix such errors. The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems."

It discusses the importance of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a framework allowing organisations to manage their goals and demonstrate compliance with regulations. Despite its importance, the maintenance of EMS is often human-driven and therefore prone to error. The paper emphasizes the need for these claims to be checked using trusted automated means to reduce burden and cost of compliance. Provenance is proposed as an ideal way to track changes in an EMS. This paper investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS and presents the application of a Provenance-By-Design strategy. This new approach offers unique opportunities for a provenance-based EMS. The paper shares preliminary reflections on the potential of this approach."
