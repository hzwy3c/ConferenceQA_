Authors must also cite any earlier work appropriately. Papers must conform to specific formatting instructions, including a maximum limit of 12 pages. Any papers not following these guidelines, including page limits, will be rejected. Authors are also required to confirm their compliance with the length limit during submission. They may include supplementary materials like full proofs as a PDF of unlimited pages, provided in the manuscript via a link. After submission, the work will be discussed among the PC members, the assigned SPC, and track chairs in both pre- and post-rebuttal phases."}]
