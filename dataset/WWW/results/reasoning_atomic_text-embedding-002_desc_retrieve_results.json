First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale.": 0.16861778497695923}, "What is the main theme of the Web Sci2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_3>>Automation and AI in all its manifestations relevant to the Web": 0.09494936466217041, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_2>>The architecture and philosophy of the Web": 0.09737968444824219, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_4>>Critical analyses of the Web and Web technologies": 0.0987277626991272, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>About>>description>>Web Science is an interdisciplinary field dedicated to understanding the complex and multiple impacts of the Web on society and vice versa.
