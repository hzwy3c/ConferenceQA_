We trace this back to a mismatch between the space of actions that the SOTA algorithm models and the space of actions that the crawler must actually choose from. Our proposed approach, the Thompson crawler (named after the Thompson sampler that drives its refresh decisions), addresses this shortcoming by more faithfully modeling the action space. On a dataset of 4,070 source pages drawn from 53 news domains over a period of 7 weeks, we show that, on average, the Thompson crawler discovers 20% more new pages, finds pages 6 hours earlier, and uses 14 fewer refreshes per 100 pages discovered than the SOTA.\n\nQuestion:What new approach is The Web Conference 2023 taking regarding the FAIR principles?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The Web Conference 2023 will embrace the FAIR principles by collecting structured metadata of the datasets, software, and methods generated by all paper submissions.", "response": "The Web Conference 2023 is focusing on distributed analytics functionality in Gaia-X-based data spaces, which adhere to the FAIR data principles."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "What was the deadline for the Research Track Abstract submission?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Important Dates>>October 2022>>October 2022_1>>Event>>Research Track Abstract submission, this is compulsory for all papers": 0, "WWW2023>>Important Dates>>October 2022>>October 2022_2>>Deadline>>Oct 13, 2022": 0, "WWW2023>>Important Dates>>October 2022>>October 2022_1>>Deadline>>Oct 6, 2022": 0, "WWW2023>>Important Dates>>November 2022>>November 2022_4>>Event>>Special Track Web4Good Full paper": 0, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>message>>Authors should consult the conference’s main Research Track CFP to ensure their submissions are aligned with broader conference expectations, scope, and theme: “Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility”.

One of the most important tasks in traffic is anomaly detection, since abnormal drivers can reduce traffic efficiency and cause safety issues. This work focuses on detecting abnormal driving behaviors from trajectories produced by highway video surveillance systems. Most of the current abnormal driving behavior detection methods focus on a limited category of abnormal behaviors that deal with a single vehicle without considering vehicular interactions. In this work, we consider the problem of detecting a variety of socially abnormal driving behaviors, i.e., behaviors that do not conform to the behavior of other nearby drivers. This task is complicated by the variety of vehicular interactions and the spatial-temporal varying nature of highway traffic. To solve this problem, we propose an autoencoder with a Recurrent Graph Attention Network that can capture the highway driving behaviors contextualized on the surrounding cars, and detect anomalies that deviate from learned patterns. Our model is scalable to large freeways with thousands of cars. Experiments on data generated from traffic simulation software show that our model is the only one that can spot the exact vehicle conducting socially abnormal behaviors, among the state-of-the-art anomaly detection models.
