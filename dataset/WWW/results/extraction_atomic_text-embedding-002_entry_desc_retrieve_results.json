Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks. Due to the deluge of such messages on social media, and their tremendous power to shape our perceptions, there has never been a greater need to automate these analyses, which play a pivotal role in fact-checking, opinion mining, understanding opinion trends, and other such downstream tasks of social consequence. In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.": 0.11066889762878418}, "What type of music does the band Money Chicha play?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_60>>authors>>authors_3>>Raúl García-Castro": 0.2571263313293457, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>POSTERS AND DEMOS CHAIRS>>members>>members_1>>affiliation>>Universidad de la República de Uruguay": 0.25762462615966797, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_23>>authors>>authors_6>>Chehara Pathmabandu": 0.2579004168510437, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_17>>authors>>authors_2>>Alejandro Cuevas": 0.2588971257209778, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>GENERAL CHAIRS>>members>>members_3>>name>>Juan Sequeda": 0.25894951820373535, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_10>>title>>Propaganda Política Pagada: Exploring U.S. Political Facebook Ads en Español": 0.2606325149536133, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_61>>authors>>authors_3>>Oscar Corcho": 0.26164233684539795, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_27>>authors>>authors_1>>Bastián Inostroza": 0.2634096145629883, "WWW2023>>calls>>Special Track>>CFP: The Creative Web>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_2>>name>>Albert Meroño-Peñuela": 0.2638968229293823, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_15>>authors>>authors_2>>Aranyak Mehta and Andres Perlroth": 0.2644609808921814, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Track chairs>>Track chairs_3>>name>>Azaraksh Malekian": 0.2648654580116272}}
