In Brazil, the teaching and learning process in several areas has been stimulated through Academic Competitions generally called Knowledge Olympics, which are essentially student contests that aim to encourage, find talent and awaken interest in the field knowledge presented in the competition. It was precisely for this purpose that the Brazilian Investment Olympics (OBInvest) was born, aiming to democratize access to education and promote reflections on economic and financial issues, through a FL perspective for high school students from all over the country. One of OBInvest’s objectives is to help boosting the development of computational tools, aiming to provide easier access to fundamental data for decision-making in the field of finance. However, from the tools developed by OBInvest, it was noted that the creation of new educational tools would be enhanced through the use of datasets enriched with provenance and aligned with FAIR principles. This work aims to offer a computational strategy based on data science techniques, which is easy to use and also provides curated data series through a reproducible pipeline, using open data on financial reports from publicly listed Brazilian companies, provided by the Brazilian Security and Exchange Commission, called Comissão de Valores Mobiliarios (CMV). During the exploration of related works, we found just a few academic works that use CVM data with little expressive results, which motivated the development of a tool called DRE-CVM, that was supported by computational tools, with a focus on the Python language, Pandas library, the KNIME workflow platform, and Jupyter integrated development environments, running on the Anaconda3 platform over a Docker container.

An eligible continual few-shot learning model is expected to distinguish all seen classes upon new categories arriving, where each category only includes very few labeled data. However, existing continual few-shot learning methods only consider the visual modality, where the distributions of new categories often indistinguishably overlap with old categories, thus resulting in the severe catastrophic forgetting problem. To tackle this problem, in this paper we study continual few-shot learning with the assistance of semantic knowledge by simultaneously taking both visual modality and semantic concepts of categories into account. We propose a Continual few-shot learning algorithm with Semantic knowledge Regularization (CoSR) for adapting to the distribution changes of visual prototypes through a Transformer-based prototype adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the original visual prototypes from the backbone are fed into the well-designed Transformer with corresponding semantic concepts, where the semantic concepts are extracted from all categories. The semantic-level regularization forces the categories with similar semantics to be closely distributed, while the opposite ones are constrained to be far away from each other. The semantic regularization improves the model’s ability to distinguish between new and old categories, thus significantly mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual few-shot learning.

That calls for the technique of weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), which requires just seed words for each category and has succeed in static text classification tasks. However, there are still no studies of applying WSTC methods in a continual learning paradigm to actually accommodate the open and evolving Internet. In this paper, we tackle this problem for the first time and propose a framework, named Continual Learning for Weakly Supervised Text Classification (CL-WSTC), which can take any WSTC method as base model. It consists of two modules, classification decision with delay and seed word updating. In the former, the probability threshold for each category in each period is adaptively learned to determine the acceptance/rejection of texts. In the latter, with candidate words output by the base model, seed words are added and deleted via reinforcement learning with immediate rewards, according to an empirically certified unsupervised measure.

We also propose a semi-supervised teacher-student learning framework to address the common issue of limited available labels in summarization datasets. We empirically evaluate our approach on extractive summarization task with the TWEETSUMM corpus, a recently introduced dialog summarization dataset from Twitter customer care conversations and demonstrate that our self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised teacher-student learning are both beneficial in comparison to other pre-trained models.

In the latter, with candidate words output by the base model, seed words are added and deleted via reinforcement learning with immediate rewards, according to an empirically certified unsupervised measure. Extensive experiments show that our approach has strong universality and can achieve a better trade-off between classification accuracy and decision timeliness compared to non-continual counterparts, with intuitively interpretable updating of seed words.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_10>>abstract>>Language model pre-training has led to state-of-the-art performance in text summarization. While a variety of pre-trained transformer models are available nowadays, they are mostly trained on documents. In this study we introduce self-supervised pre-training to enhance the BERT model’s semantic and structural understanding of dialog texts from social media. We also propose a semi-supervised teacher-student learning framework to address the common issue of limited available labels in summarization datasets. We empirically evaluate our approach on extractive summarization task with the TWEETSUMM corpus, a recently introduced dialog summarization dataset from Twitter customer care conversations and demonstrate that our self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised teacher-student learning are both beneficial in comparison to other pre-trained models. Additionally, we compare pre-training and teacher-student learning in various low data-resource settings, and find that pre-training outperforms teacher-student learning and the differences between the two are more significant when the available labels are scarce.\n\nQuestion:What is the website link for the tutorial 'Never-Ending Learning, Lifelong Learning and Continual Learning in the Era of Large Pre-Trained Language Models'?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The website link for the tutorial 'Never-Ending Learning, Lifelong Learning and Continual Learning in the Era of Large Pre-Trained Language Models' is 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X_iBuDGFA3P9ue5FO2P9YW_b5WcdL6uH/view'.", "response": "The website link for the tutorial 'Never-Ending Learning, Lifelong Learning and Continual Learning in the Era of Large Pre-Trained Language Models' is not provided in the given context."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "Is there a policy for professional conduct or behavior for attendees?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>extraCriteria>>designAndTechnicalQuality>>criteria>>criteria_3>>Does it use open standards when applicable, or does it have a good reason not to?": 0.014023661613464355, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>extraCriteria>>availability>>criteria>>criteria_5>>Is there a good sustainability and maintenance plan specified for the resource?": 0.014408349990844727, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Posters and Demos Proposals>>extraCriteria>>availability>>criteria>>criteria_2>>Does the artifact provide a (preferably open) license specification?

To crack the code, you need to crack the culture that makes us who we are. Who and what is creative remains largely disconnected from diverse and global cultural norms, rendering existing technology suboptimal and even unusable to the world’s majority. Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks.

To crack the code, you need to crack the culture that makes us who we are. Who and what is creative remains largely disconnected from diverse and global cultural norms, rendering existing technology suboptimal and even unusable to the world’s majority. Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation.

Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the users of these systems at scale. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query logs of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. Compared with Web search queries, text-to-image prompts are significantly longer, often organized into special structures that consist of the subject, form, and intent of the generation tasks and present unique categories of information needs. Users make more edits within creation sessions, which present remarkable exploratory patterns. There is also a considerable gap between the user-input prompts and the captions of the images included in the open training data of the generative models.

Compared with the baseline, CoTel can reduce the time cost by 64.75% (a 2.84× speedup) and the number of labeling by 62.07%.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_36>>abstract>>Since its beginnings, web pages have been based on files. This means that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are transferred from server to client as files, which by default need to be fully loaded before the web page is displayed. This render-blocking procedure increases loading times significantly, leading to reduced user satisfaction and revenue loss due to lower conversion rates. We present a full implementation of a new approach for loading web pages by splitting up every component and loading the page via a text-based stream. Such a modification aligns with current trends of the HTTP protocol, which has been using streams internally since HTTP/2. It significantly improves loading times, independent of the total page size.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_4>>abstract>>Recent developments in large language models (LLM) and generative AI have unleashed the astonishing capabilities of text-to-image generation systems to synthesize high-quality images that are faithful to a given reference text, known as a “prompt”. These systems have immediately received lots of attention from researchers, creators, and common users. Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the users of these systems at scale. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query logs of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. Compared with Web search queries, text-to-image prompts are significantly longer, often organized into special structures that consist of the subject, form, and intent of the generation tasks and present unique categories of information needs. Users make more edits within creation sessions, which present remarkable exploratory patterns. There is also a considerable gap between the user-input prompts and the captions of the images included in the open training data of the generative models. Our findings provide concrete implications on how to improve text-to-image generation systems for creation purposes.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_25>>abstract>>In a globalized marketplace, one could access products or services from almost anywhere. However, resolving which product in one language corresponds to another product in a different language remains an under-explored problem. We explore this from two perspectives. First, given two products of different languages, how to assess their similarity that could signal a potential match. Second, given products from various languages, how to arrive at a multi-partite clustering that respects cardinality constraints efficiently. We describe algorithms for each perspective and integrate them into a promising solution validated on real-world datasets.\n\nQuestion:How many options are there if divide the registration type according to the time period?\nAnswer:", "gt": "There will be three options: \nFull Conference (5 days: April 30 - May 4), Workshop, Tutorial.\nSpecial Days, W4A, WebSci, Provenance (2 Days: April 30 - May 1).\nMain Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)", "response": "There is no information provided in the given context to answer this question."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "What is the average difference in registration fees between ACM members and non-ACM members?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>authors>>authors_5>>Rossana Damiano": 0.015195131301879883, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>authors>>authors_3>>Valerio Basile": 0.01531219482421875, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_1>>authors>>authors_4>>Albert Meroño-Peñuela": 0.015341520309448242, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_1>>authors>>authors_6>>Enrico Daga": 0.015431642532348633, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>authors>>authors_4>>Viviana Patti": 0.01543968915939331}, "from": "WWW2023/Attendees/Registration/Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
