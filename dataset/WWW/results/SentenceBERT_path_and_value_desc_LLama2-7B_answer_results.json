SocialNLP has three directions: (1) addressing issues in social computing using NLP techniques; (2) solving NLP problems using information from social networks or social media; and (3) handling new problems related to both social computing and natural language processing. The 11th SocialNLP workshop is held at TheWebConf 2023. We accepted nine papers with acceptance ratio 56%. We sincerely thank to all authors, program committee members, and workshop chairs, for their great contributions and help in this edition of SocialNLP workshop.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_1>>title>>SocialNLP’23: 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3589754\n\nWWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_17>>website>>https://sites.google.com/view/socialnlp2023/\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_10>>authors>>authors_4>>Anurag Beniwal\n\nQuestion:What is the main objective of the 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The main objective of the 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP) is to explore the interdisciplinary area of natural language processing (NLP) and social computing, addressing three directions: issues in social computing using NLP techniques, solving NLP problems leveraging social network or social media information, and handling new problems related to both social computing and NLP.", "response": "I don't know.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>"}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "What type of music does the band Money Chicha play?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_180>>authors>>authors_5>>Qi Song": 0.23891568183898926, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_357>>authors>>authors_3>>Xiang Song": 0.2415773868560791, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_48>>authors>>authors_5>>Qi Song": 0.25231099128723145, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_50>>authors>>authors_4>>Guojie Song": 0.2570900321006775, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_47>>title>>Catch: Collaborative Feature Set Search for Automated Feature Engineering": 0.2654458284378052}, "from": "WWW2023>>Program>>BBQ and Live Music>>Money Chicha>>description", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
