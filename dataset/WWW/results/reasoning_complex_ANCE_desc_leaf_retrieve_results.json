If so, what are their title and organizers?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_60>>abstract>>In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been popular in the graph classification task. Currently, shallow GNNs are more common due to the well-known over-smoothing problem facing deeper GNNs. However, they are sub-optimal without utilizing the information from distant nodes, i.e., the long-range dependencies. The mainstream methods in the graph classification task can extract the long-range dependencies either by designing the pooling operations or incorporating the higher-order neighbors, while they have evident drawbacks by modifying the original graph structure, which may result in information loss in graph structure learning. In this paper, by justifying the smaller influence of the over-smoothing problem in the graph classification task, we evoke the importance of stacking-based GNNs and then employ them to capture the long-range dependencies without modifying the original graph structure. To achieve this, two design needs are given for stacking-based GNNs, i.e., sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes. By transforming the two design needs into designing data-specific inter-layer connections, we propose a novel approach with the help of neural architecture search (NAS), which is dubbed LRGNN (Long-Range Graph Neural Networks). Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed LRGNN can achieve the best performance, and obtained data-specific GNNs with different depth and skip-connection schemes, which can better capture the long-range dependencies. 1": 0.009774088859558105, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_36>>title>>Joint Internal Multi-Interest Exploration and External Domain Alignment for Cross Domain Sequential Recommendation": 0.009972453117370605, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_22>>title>>Disentangling Degree-related Biases and Interest for Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding": 0.010176658630371094}, "Are there any tutorials related to multi modal in this conference?

To achieve this, two design needs are given for stacking-based GNNs, i.e., sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes. By transforming the two design needs into designing data-specific inter-layer connections, we propose a novel approach with the help of neural architecture search (NAS), which is dubbed LRGNN (Long-Range Graph Neural Networks). Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed LRGNN can achieve the best performance, and obtained data-specific GNNs with different depth and skip-connection schemes, which can better capture the long-range dependencies. 1": 0.009708583354949951}, "Will registration fees change over time?": {"WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)_3>>Standard March 16 - April 29>>$550": 0.011976003646850586, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Workshop, Tutorial, Special Days, W4A, WebSci, Provenance (2 Days: April 30 - May 1)>>Workshop, Tutorial, Special Days, W4A, WebSci, Provenance (2 Days: April 30 - May 1)_2>>Standard March 16 - April 29>>$750": 0.01223766803741455, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)_2>>Type>>NON-ACM Members": 0.012695729732513428, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Workshop, Tutorial, Special Days, W4A, WebSci, Provenance (2 Days: April 30 - May 1)>>Workshop, Tutorial, Special Days, W4A, WebSci, Provenance (2 Days: April 30 - May 1)_1>>Standard March 16 - April 29>>$650": 0.013002932071685791, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Virtual Conference>>ACM Members>>$300": 0.013041198253631592, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)_2>>Onsite>>$1150": 0.013315916061401367, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Full Conference (5 days: April 30 - May 4)>>Full Conference (5 days: April 30 - May 4)_3>>Standard March 16 - April 29>>$1000": 0.013321995735168457, "WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)_3>>Onsite>>$600": 0.013343274593353271}, "Can I register for this conference with different time slots?": {"WWW2023>>Attendees>>Registration>>Register Fee(All fees in US dollars)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)>>Main Conference (3 days: May 2 - May 4)_3>>Onsite>>$600": 0.01127082109451294, "WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_2>>date>>Monday May 1": 0.011560559272766113, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>desciption>>This year, ACM WebSci’23 is co-located with The Web Conference.

Some existing work adopts users’ past engagement to infer style preference. These methods cannot help users discover new styles. Other work requires users to provide text or visual signals to describe their style preference, but users often are not familiar with style terms and do not have the right image to start with. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) method to help users explore and exploit style space without requiring extra user input.
