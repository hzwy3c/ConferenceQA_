However, existing explainability techniques often require dedicated backend servers, which limit their usefulness as the Web community moves toward in-browser ML for lower latency and greater privacy. To address the pressing need for a client-side explainability solution, we present WebSHAP, the first in-browser tool that adapts the state-of-the-art model-agnostic explainability technique SHAP to the Web environment. Our open-source tool is developed with modern Web technologies such as WebGL that leverage client-side hardware capabilities and make it easy to integrate into existing Web ML applications. We demonstrate WebSHAP in a usage scenario of explaining ML-based loan approval decisions to loan applicants. Reflecting on our work, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for future research on transparent Web ML. WebSHAP is available at https://github.com/poloclub/webshap.": 0.11292541027069092,

However, with their inherently recursive message propagation among neighboring nodes, existing GNN-based CF models may generate indistinguishable and inaccurate user (item) representations due to the over-smoothing and noise effect with low-pass Laplacian smoothing operators. In addition, the recursive information propagation with the stacked aggregators in the entire graph structures may result in poor scalability in practical applications. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a simple and effective collaborative filtering model (SimRec) that marries the power of knowledge distillation and contrastive learning. In SimRec, adaptive transferring knowledge is enabled between the teacher GNN model and a lightweight student network, to not only preserve the global collaborative signals, but also address the over-smoothing issue with representation recalibration. Empirical results on public datasets show that SimRec archives better efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation performance compared with various strong baselines. Our implementations are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/SimRec.": 0.17166781425476074

As an illustration, it has been observed that 10 languages possess half of the available Wikipedia articles, despite the existence of 330 Wikipedia language editions. To address this issue, this study presents an approach to identify the information gap between the different language editions of Wikipedia. The proposed approach employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze linked entities in a cross-lingual knowledge graph in order to determine topic distributions for Wikipedia articles in 28 languages. The distance between paired articles across language editions is then calculated. The potential applications of the proposed algorithm to detecting sources of information disparity in Wikipedia are discussed, and directions for future research are put forward.": 0.1728370189666748

It can be used for similar products retrieval from different suppliers or duplicate products detection of one supplier. Common methods use the image as the detected object, but they only consider the visual features and overlook the attribute information contained in the textual descriptions, and perform weakly for products in image less important industries like machinery, hardware tools and electronic component, even if an additional text matching module is added. In this paper, we propose a unified vision-language modeling method for e-commerce same-style products retrieval, which is designed to represent one product with its textual descriptions and visual contents. It contains one sampling skill to collect positive pairs from user click logs with category and relevance constrained, and a novel contrastive loss unit to model the image, text, and image+text representations into one joint embedding space. It is capable of cross-modal product-to-product retrieval, as well as style transfer and user-interactive search. Offline evaluations on annotated data demonstrate its superior retrieval performance, and online testings show it can attract more clicks and conversions. Moreover, this model has already been deployed online for similar products retrieval in alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.": 0.1812138557434082

However, black-box approaches have raised fundamental concerns for ethics, accountability, explainability, and musical plausibility. To enable trustworthy machine creativity, we introduce the Harmonic Memory, a Knowledge Graph (KG) of harmonic patterns extracted from a large and heterogeneous musical corpus. By leveraging a cognitive model of tonal harmony, chord progressions are segmented into meaningful structures, and patterns emerge from their comparison via harmonic similarity. Akin to a music memory, the KG holds temporal connections between consecutive patterns, as well as salient similarity relationships. After demonstrating the validity of our choices, we provide examples of how this design enables novel pathways for combinational creativity. The memory provides a fully accountable and explainable framework to inspire and support creative professionals – allowing for the discovery of progressions consistent with given criteria, the recomposition of harmonic sections, but also the co-creation of new progressions.": 0.10133588314056396

To address this gap, several ML models aim to automatically detect useful insights from charts and narrate them in a simpler textual format. However, most of these solutions can only detect basic factual insights (a.k.a. descriptive insights) that are already present in the chart, which may help with chart comprehension, but not decision-making. In this work, we study whether more advanced predictive and investigative insights can help users understand what will happen next and what actions they should take. These advanced insights can help decision-makers better understand the reasons behind anomaly events, predict future unfolding trends, and recommend possible actions for optimizing business outcomes. Through a study with 18 participants, we found that predictive and investigative insights lead to more insights recorded by users on average and better effectiveness ratings.": 0.14218395948410034

A vast amount of work is being carried out in QA systems to deliver better content satisfying users’ information needs [2]. Since QA systems are ascending the cycle of emerging technologies, there are potential research gaps that can be explored. QA systems form a significant part of Conversational Artificial Intelligent systems giving rise to a new research pathway, i.e., Conversational Question Answering (CQA) systems [32]. We propose to design and develop a CQA system leveraging Hypergraph-based techniques. The approach focuses on the multi-turn conversation and multi-context to gauge users’ exact information needs and deliver better answers. We further aim to address \"supporting evidence-based retrieval\" for fact-based responsible answer generation. Since the QA system requires a large amount of data and processing, we also intend to investigate hardware performance for effective system utilization.": 0.1552867293357849,

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

Following a short introduction motivating the reason why this issue has to be considered as pivotal both for the Web and for the society, the main problem raised by the research will be identified, namely, whether an action taken against a person, that in real-life would be a criminal conduct, is considerable as a crime in the Metaverse as well. A short assessment of the (very little so far) current state of the art, as well as the proposed approach and methodology will be then overviewed; finally, the contribution shows its current results, and concludes stating that countries are highly encouraged to shape respective criminal frameworks when applied to the Metaverse, and that the international community should consider the topic as a priority in its agenda. Nevertheless, further experimental and research work has still to be made.": 0.13072359561920166,

As an illustration, it has been observed that 10 languages possess half of the available Wikipedia articles, despite the existence of 330 Wikipedia language editions. To address this issue, this study presents an approach to identify the information gap between the different language editions of Wikipedia. The proposed approach employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze linked entities in a cross-lingual knowledge graph in order to determine topic distributions for Wikipedia articles in 28 languages. The distance between paired articles across language editions is then calculated. The potential applications of the proposed algorithm to detecting sources of information disparity in Wikipedia are discussed, and directions for future research are put forward.": 0.18157368898391724,

The increasingly popular low latency live streaming (LLLS) faces greater challenges since it requires accurate, short-term bandwidth prediction, compared with VOD streaming which needs long-term bandwidth prediction and has good tolerance against prediction error. Part of the challenges comes from the fact that short-term bandwidth experiences both large abrupt changes and uncertain fluctuations. Additionally, it is hard to obtain valid bandwidth measurement samples in LLLS due to its inter-chunk and intra-chunk sending idleness. In this work, we present DeeProphet, a system for accurate bandwidth prediction in LLLS to improve the performance of HAS. DeeProphet overcomes the above challenges by collecting valid measurement samples using fine-grained TCP state information to identify the packet bursting intervals, and by combining the time series model and learning-based model to predict both large change and uncertain fluctuations. Experiment results show that DeeProphet improves the overall QoE by 17.7%-359.2% compared with state-of-the-art LLLS ABR algorithms, and reduces the median bandwidth prediction error to 2.7%.": 0.23788577318191528

The Accord Project provides an open-source SLC framework containing three main modules: Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo. Currently, we need lawyers, programmers, and clients to work together with great effort to create a usable SLC using the Accord Project. This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project’s Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text. We also delve into some limitations and possible future research for the proposed pipeline. Finally, we describe a web interface enabling users to build SLCs. This interface leverages the proposed pipeline to convert text documents to Smart Legal Contracts by using NLP models.": 0.14138996601104736,

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system.": 0.1696927547454834

As an illustration, it has been observed that 10 languages possess half of the available Wikipedia articles, despite the existence of 330 Wikipedia language editions. To address this issue, this study presents an approach to identify the information gap between the different language editions of Wikipedia. The proposed approach employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze linked entities in a cross-lingual knowledge graph in order to determine topic distributions for Wikipedia articles in 28 languages. The distance between paired articles across language editions is then calculated.

The Metaverse, as a link between the real and virtual worlds, can provide users with immersive experiences. As the concept of the Metaverse grows in popularity, many scholars and developers begin to focus on the Metaverse’s ethics and core. This paper argues that the Metaverse should be centered on humans. That is, humans constitute the majority of the Metaverse. As a result, we begin this paper by introducing the Metaverse’s origins, characteristics, related technologies, and the concept of the human-centric Metaverse (HCM). Second, we discuss the manifestation of human-centric in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss some current issues in the construction of HCM. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the applications of human-centric technologies in the Metaverse, as well as the relevant HCM application scenarios.

Data exchange within and across different healthcare organizations require explicit and shared semantics that biomedical ontologies and controlled vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD9, LOINC, RxNorm) have been widely implemented in the clinical decision-making systems. Aggregating heterogeneous healthcare data becomes doable which is essential for evidence-based care.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Web Developer and W3C>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Web Developer and W3C_1>>abstract>>This paper presents WAM Studio, an open source, online Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that takes advantages of several W3C Web APIs, such as Web Audio, Web Assembly, Web Components, Web Midi, Media Devices etc. It also uses the Web Audio Modules proposal that has been designed to facilitate the development of inter-operable audio plugins (effects, virtual instruments, virtual piano keyboards as controllers etc.) and host applications. DAWs are feature-rich software and therefore particularly complex to develop in terms of design, implementation, performances and ergonomics. Very few commercial online DAWs exist today and the only open-source examples lack features (no support for inter-operable plugins, for example) and do not take advantage of the recent possibilities offered by modern W3C APIs (e.g. AudioWorklets/Web Assembly). WAM Studio was developed as an open-source technology demonstrator with the aim of showcasing the potential of the web platform, made possible by these APIs. The paper highlights some of the difficulties we encountered (i.e limitations due to the sandboxed and constrained environments that are Web browsers, latency compensation etc.). An online demo, as well as a GitHub repository for the source code are available.": 0.13105881214141846

Due to the increasing popularity of this business model, thousands of small producers and re-sellers are starting to depend on these platforms for their livelihood; thus, it is important to provide fair earning opportunities to them. The enormous product space in such platforms prohibits manual search, and motivates the need for recommendation algorithms to effectively allocate product exposure and, consequently, earning opportunities. In this work, we focus on the fairness of such allocations in social commerce platforms and formulate the problem of assigning products to re-sellers as a fair division problem with indivisible items under two-sided cardinality constraints, wherein each product must be given to at least a certain number of re-sellers and each re-seller must get a certain number of products.": 0.1518099308013916,

While maintaining high competence in user modeling and next-item recommendation, these models have long been plagued by the numerous parameters and computation, which inhibit them to be deployed on resource-constrained mobile devices. Model quantization, as one of the main paradigms for compression techniques, converts float parameters to low-bit values to reduce parameter redundancy and accelerate inference. To avoid drastic performance degradation, it usually requests a fine-tuning phase with an original dataset. However, the training set of user-item interactions is not always available due to transmission limits or privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to quantize sequential recommenders without access to any real private data. A generator is employed in the framework to synthesize fake sequence samples to feed the quantized sequential recommendation model and minimize the gap with a full-precision sequential recommendation model. The generator and the quantized model are optimized with a min-max game — alternating discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer. Moreover, we devise a two-level discrepancy modeling strategy to transfer information between the quantized model and the full-precision model. The extensive experiments of various recommendation networks on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.": 0.18116700649261475,

Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect). The extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of computational complexity, number of parameters, and latency measures.": 0.21588999032974243

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising paradigm for this goal, as it directly optimizes overall performance of sequential recommendation. However, many existing RL-based approaches induce huge computational overhead, because they require not only the recommended items but also all other candidate items to be stored. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work. With online A/B experiments on real-world RS, we confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach and the importance of modeling the two types of randomness.": 0.21506839990615845,

However, simply considering each click equally in training may suffer from clickbaits and title-content mismatching, and thus fail to precisely capture users’ real satisfaction on items. Dwell time could be viewed as a high-quality quantitative indicator of user preferences on each click, while existing recommendation models do not fully explore the modeling of dwell time. In this work, we focus on reweighting clicks with dwell time in recommendation. Precisely, we first define a new behavior named valid read, which helps to select high-quality click instances for different users and items via dwell time. Next, we propose a normalized dwell time function to reweight click signals in training for recommendation. The Click reweighting model achieves significant improvements on both offline and online evaluations in real-world systems.": 0.18860173225402832

Assuming Gaussian noise, we analytically optimize the rank-order payment function, and identify a sufficient statistic, sensitivity, which serves as a metric for optimizing the performance measurements. This helps us obtain (1), (2) and (3) simultaneously.

As an illustration, it has been observed that 10 languages possess half of the available Wikipedia articles, despite the existence of 330 Wikipedia language editions. To address this issue, this study presents an approach to identify the information gap between the different language editions of Wikipedia. The proposed approach employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze linked entities in a cross-lingual knowledge graph in order to determine topic distributions for Wikipedia articles in 28 languages. The distance between paired articles across language editions is then calculated. The potential applications of the proposed algorithm to detecting sources of information disparity in Wikipedia are discussed, and directions for future research are put forward.": 0.13131725788116455,

Existing methods rely either on metrics computed by systems that are effective but subject to errors and bias, or experts’ ratings, which are accurate but expensive and long to collect. Crowdsourcing offers a compelling way to evaluate a large number of design ideas in a short amount of time while being cost-effective.

First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale.": 0.15922671556472778,

The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau. The International World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2) was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW became an annual event held in late April or early May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.": 0.12293821573257446

However, a user may provide very few examples, even none at the beginning of interaction, thereby limiting the effectiveness of such methods. In this paper, we vision a more practical scenario called labeling-based iterative relevance search: instead of effortfully inputting example answer entities, the user effortlessly (e.g., implicitly) labels current answer entities, and is rewarded with improved answer entities in the next iteration. To realize the scenario, our approach TRAVERS incorporates two rankers: a diversity-oriented ranker for supporting cold start and avoiding converging to sub-optimum caused by noisy labels, and a relevance-oriented ranker capable of handling unbalanced labels. Moreover, the two rankers and their combination dynamically evolve over iterations.

In this paper, we first point out the three drawbacks of existing similarity-based embedding methods: inaccurate similarity computation, conflicting optimization goal, and impairing in/out-degree distributions. Then, motivated by these drawbacks, we propose AdaSim*, a novel similarity measure for graphs that is conducive to the similarity-based graph embedding. We finally propose GELTOR, an effective embedding method that employs AdaSim* as a node similarity measure and the concept of learning-to-rank in the embedding process. Contrary to existing methods, GELTOR does not learn the similarity scores distribution; instead, for any target node, GELTOR conforms the ranks of its top-t similar nodes in the embedding space to their original ranks based on AdaSim* scores. We conduct extensive experiments with six real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of GELTOR in graph reconstruction, link prediction, and node classification tasks. Our experimental results show that (1) AdaSim* outperforms AdaSim, RWR, and MCT in computing nodes similarity in graphs, (2) our GETLOR outperforms existing state-of-the-arts and conventional embedding methods in most cases of the above machine learning tasks, thereby implying that learning-to-rank is beneficial to graph embedding.": 0.17027759552001953,

The increasingly popular low latency live streaming (LLLS) faces greater challenges since it requires accurate, short-term bandwidth prediction, compared with VOD streaming which needs long-term bandwidth prediction and has good tolerance against prediction error. Part of the challenges comes from the fact that short-term bandwidth experiences both large abrupt changes and uncertain fluctuations. Additionally, it is hard to obtain valid bandwidth measurement samples in LLLS due to its inter-chunk and intra-chunk sending idleness. In this work, we present DeeProphet, a system for accurate bandwidth prediction in LLLS to improve the performance of HAS. DeeProphet overcomes the above challenges by collecting valid measurement samples using fine-grained TCP state information to identify the packet bursting intervals, and by combining the time series model and learning-based model to predict both large change and uncertain fluctuations. Experiment results show that DeeProphet improves the overall QoE by 17.7%-359.2% compared with state-of-the-art LLLS ABR algorithms, and reduces the median bandwidth prediction error to 2.7%.": 0.18943655490875244,

Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains.

Specifically, a knowledge graph that represents and stores facts about EA practice allows for what it is so far only accessible manually to become machine-readable, and by this, to enable downstream information access services. This paper describes the ongoing process of building DreamsKG, a knowledge graph that stores relevant data- and expert-driven EA reporting and practicing in Denmark. Representation of cause-effect relations in EA and integration of Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) are among its prominent features.": 0.14952141046524048,

Learning Analytics is the process of measuring, collecting, recording, and analysing this Student Activity Data. Predictive Learning Analytics, a sub-field of Learning Analytics, can help to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or failing, as well as students who are close to a grade boundary. Course tutors can use the insights provided by the analyses to offer timely assistance to these students. Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.": 0.16529852151870728,

We discover that the two methods behave very differently depending on the sparsity of the data set, where sparsity is defined by the amount of historical viewing data available to explain a movie recommendation for a particular data instance. We find that LIME does better than SHAP in dense segments of the data set and SHAP does better in sparse segments. We trace this difference to the differing bias-variance characteristics of the underlying estimators of LIME and SHAP. We find that SHAP exhibits lower variance in sparse segments of the data compared to LIME. We attribute this lower variance to the completeness constraint property inherent in SHAP and missing in LIME. This constraint acts as a regularizer and therefore increases the bias of the SHAP estimator but decreases its variance, leading to a favorable bias-variance trade-off especially in high sparsity data settings. With this insight, we introduce the same constraint into LIME and formulate a novel local explainabilty framework called Completeness-Constrained LIME (CLIME) that is superior to LIME and much faster than SHAP.": 0.20262861251831055,

They have widespread applications in scientific innovation, creative writing, and education. The ability to discover creative analogies that are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the web is highly desirable to power all such applications dynamically and augment human creativity. Recently, Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), trained on massive Web data, have shown great promise in generating mostly known analogies that are explicitly mentioned on the Web. However, it is unclear how they could be leveraged for mining creative analogies not explicitly mentioned on the Web. We address this challenge and propose Creative Analogy Mining (CAM), a novel framework for mining creative analogies, which consists of the following three main steps: 1) Generate analogies using PLMs with effectively designed prompts, 2) Evaluate their quality using scoring functions, and 3) Refine the low-quality analogies by another round of prompt-based generation. We propose both unsupervised and supervised instantiations of the framework so that it can be used even without any annotated data. Based on human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we find that our unsupervised framework can mine 13.7% highly-creative and 56.37% somewhat-creative analogies. Moreover, our supervised scores are generally better than the unsupervised ones and correlate moderately with human evaluators, indicating that they would be even more effective at mining creative analogies. These findings also shed light on the creativity of PLMs 1.": 0.16472208499908447,

To address this gap, several ML models aim to automatically detect useful insights from charts and narrate them in a simpler textual format. However, most of these solutions can only detect basic factual insights (a.k.a. descriptive insights) that are already present in the chart, which may help with chart comprehension, but not decision-making. In this work, we study whether more advanced predictive and investigative insights can help users understand what will happen next and what actions they should take. These advanced insights can help decision-makers better understand the reasons behind anomaly events, predict future unfolding trends, and recommend possible actions for optimizing business outcomes. Through a study with 18 participants, we found that predictive and investigative insights lead to more insights recorded by users on average and better effectiveness ratings.": 0.19054526090621948,

It can be used for similar products retrieval from different suppliers or duplicate products detection of one supplier. Common methods use the image as the detected object, but they only consider the visual features and overlook the attribute information contained in the textual descriptions, and perform weakly for products in image less important industries like machinery, hardware tools and electronic component, even if an additional text matching module is added. In this paper, we propose a unified vision-language modeling method for e-commerce same-style products retrieval, which is designed to represent one product with its textual descriptions and visual contents. It contains one sampling skill to collect positive pairs from user click logs with category and relevance constrained, and a novel contrastive loss unit to model the image, text, and image+text representations into one joint embedding space. It is capable of cross-modal product-to-product retrieval, as well as style transfer and user-interactive search. Offline evaluations on annotated data demonstrate its superior retrieval performance, and online testings show it can attract more clicks and conversions. Moreover, this model has already been deployed online for similar products retrieval in alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.": 0.17813360691070557,

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_22>>abstract>>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models to handle graph data and can achieve state-of-the-art in many critical tasks including node classification and link prediction. However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.": 0.1114550232887268

Learning Analytics is the process of measuring, collecting, recording, and analysing this Student Activity Data. Predictive Learning Analytics, a sub-field of Learning Analytics, can help to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or failing, as well as students who are close to a grade boundary. Course tutors can use the insights provided by the analyses to offer timely assistance to these students. Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.": 0.1934574842453003

For example, in toxic language detection, comments targeting different demographic groups can vary markedly across groups. In such settings, trained models can be dominated by the relationships that best fit the majority group, leading to disparate performance. We propose framing toxicity detection as multi-task learning (MTL), allowing a model to specialize on the relationships that are relevant to each demographic group while also leveraging shared properties across groups. With toxicity detection, each task corresponds to identifying toxicity against a particular demographic group. However, traditional MTL requires labels for all tasks to be present for every data point. To address this, we propose Conditional MTL (CondMTL), wherein only training examples relevant to the given demographic group are considered by the loss function. This lets us learn group specific representations in each branch which are not cross contaminated by irrelevant labels.

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_7>>abstract>>The creative web is all about combining different types of media to create a unique and engaging online experience. Multimodal data, such as text and images, is a key component in the creative web. Social media posts that incorporate both text descriptions and images offer a wealth of information and context. Text in social media posts typically relates to one topic, while images often convey information about multiple topics due to the richness of visual content. Despite this potential, many existing multimodal topic models do not take these criteria into account, resulting in poor quality topics being generated. Therefore, we proposed a Coherent Topic modeling for Multimodal Data (CTM-MM), which takes into account that text in social media posts typically relates to one topic, while images can contain information about multiple topics. Our experimental results show that CTM-MM outperforms traditional multimodal topic models in terms of classification and topic coherence.": 0.13736498355865479

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_27>>abstract>>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in sequential recommendation systems. While maintaining high competence in user modeling and next-item recommendation, these models have long been plagued by the numerous parameters and computation, which inhibit them to be deployed on resource-constrained mobile devices. Model quantization, as one of the main paradigms for compression techniques, converts float parameters to low-bit values to reduce parameter redundancy and accelerate inference. To avoid drastic performance degradation, it usually requests a fine-tuning phase with an original dataset. However, the training set of user-item interactions is not always available due to transmission limits or privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to quantize sequential recommenders without access to any real private data. A generator is employed in the framework to synthesize fake sequence samples to feed the quantized sequential recommendation model and minimize the gap with a full-precision sequential recommendation model. The generator and the quantized model are optimized with a min-max game — alternating discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer. Moreover, we devise a two-level discrepancy modeling strategy to transfer information between the quantized model and the full-precision model. The extensive experiments of various recommendation networks on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.": 0.20673644542694092,

To deal with the massive web contents, DRS employs a two-stage workflow: retrieval and ranking, to generate its recommendation results. The retriever aims to select a small set of relevant candidates from the entire items with high efficiency; while the ranker, usually more precise but time-consuming, is supposed to further refine the best items from the retrieved candidates. Traditionally, the two components are trained either independently or within a simple cascading pipeline, which is prone to poor collaboration effect. Though some latest works suggested to train retriever and ranker jointly, there still exist many severe limitations: item distribution shift between training and inference, false negative, and misalignment of ranking order. As such, it remains to explore effective collaborations between retriever and ranker.": 0.2158522605895996

The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to generate multi-objective policies for four different psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal cases. We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses. Our system’s success in generating DIsorder-Specific Multi-Objective Policies (DISMOP) and interpretable policy dynamics demonstrates the potential of DRL in providing personalized and efficient therapeutic recommendations.": 0.1404361128807068,

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising paradigm for this goal, as it directly optimizes overall performance of sequential recommendation. However, many existing RL-based approaches induce huge computational overhead, because they require not only the recommended items but also all other candidate items to be stored. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work. With online A/B experiments on real-world RS, we confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach and the importance of modeling the two types of randomness.": 0.18565577268600464

In this paper, we first point out the three drawbacks of existing similarity-based embedding methods: inaccurate similarity computation, conflicting optimization goal, and impairing in/out-degree distributions. Then, motivated by these drawbacks, we propose AdaSim*, a novel similarity measure for graphs that is conducive to the similarity-based graph embedding. We finally propose GELTOR, an effective embedding method that employs AdaSim* as a node similarity measure and the concept of learning-to-rank in the embedding process. Contrary to existing methods, GELTOR does not learn the similarity scores distribution; instead, for any target node, GELTOR conforms the ranks of its top-t similar nodes in the embedding space to their original ranks based on AdaSim* scores. We conduct extensive experiments with six real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of GELTOR in graph reconstruction, link prediction, and node classification tasks. Our experimental results show that (1) AdaSim* outperforms AdaSim, RWR, and MCT in computing nodes similarity in graphs, (2) our GETLOR outperforms existing state-of-the-arts and conventional embedding methods in most cases of the above machine learning tasks, thereby implying that learning-to-rank is beneficial to graph embedding.": 0.20850282907485962,

They have widespread applications in scientific innovation, creative writing, and education. The ability to discover creative analogies that are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the web is highly desirable to power all such applications dynamically and augment human creativity. Recently, Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), trained on massive Web data, have shown great promise in generating mostly known analogies that are explicitly mentioned on the Web. However, it is unclear how they could be leveraged for mining creative analogies not explicitly mentioned on the Web. We address this challenge and propose Creative Analogy Mining (CAM), a novel framework for mining creative analogies, which consists of the following three main steps: 1) Generate analogies using PLMs with effectively designed prompts, 2) Evaluate their quality using scoring functions, and 3) Refine the low-quality analogies by another round of prompt-based generation. We propose both unsupervised and supervised instantiations of the framework so that it can be used even without any annotated data. Based on human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we find that our unsupervised framework can mine 13.7% highly-creative and 56.37% somewhat-creative analogies. Moreover, our supervised scores are generally better than the unsupervised ones and correlate moderately with human evaluators, indicating that they would be even more effective at mining creative analogies. These findings also shed light on the creativity of PLMs 1.": 0.20614343881607056

Given a user query, the retrieval phase returns a subset of candidate products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-specific pre-training model (referred to as MAKE) outperforms existing V+L pre-training methods on the text-to-multimodal retrieval task.

Thus developing GCN models that are robust to such attacks become a hot research topic. However, the structural purification learning-based or robustness constraints-based defense GCN methods are usually designed for specific data or attacks, and introduce additional objective that is not for classification. Extra training overhead is also required in their design. To address these challenges, we conduct in-depth explorations on mid-frequency signals on graphs and propose a simple yet effective Mid-pass filter GCN (Mid-GCN). Theoretical analyses guarantee the robustness of signals through the mid-pass filter, and we also shed light on the properties of different frequency signals under adversarial attacks.

However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

We first present a unified problem formulation of diverse graph unlearning tasks w.r.t. node, edge, and feature. Then, we recognize the crux to the inability of traditional influence function for graph unlearning, and devise Graph Influence Function (GIF), a model-agnostic unlearning method that can efficiently and accurately estimate parameter changes in response to a ϵ -mass perturbation in deleted data. The idea is to supplement the objective of the traditional influence function with an additional loss term of the influenced neighbors due to the structural dependency. Further deductions on the closed-form solution of parameter changes provide a better understanding of the unlearning mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on four representative GNN models and three benchmark datasets to justify the superiority of GIF for diverse graph unlearning tasks in terms of unlearning efficacy, model utility, and unlearning efficiency.

The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to generate multi-objective policies for four different psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal cases. We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising paradigm for this goal, as it directly optimizes overall performance of sequential recommendation. However, many existing RL-based approaches induce huge computational overhead, because they require not only the recommended items but also all other candidate items to be stored. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work. With online A/B experiments on real-world RS, we confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach and the importance of modeling the two types of randomness.": 0.1967531442642212

As such, EA is a key tool for sustainability. Improving information access to EA reporting is a billion-euro untapped business opportunity to build an engaging, efficient digital experience for EA. We aim to become a landmark initiative in making this experience come true, by transforming the traditional manual assessment of numerous heterogeneous reports by experts into a computer-assisted approach. Specifically, a knowledge graph that represents and stores facts about EA practice allows for what it is so far only accessible manually to become machine-readable, and by this, to enable downstream information access services. This paper describes the ongoing process of building DreamsKG, a knowledge graph that stores relevant data- and expert-driven EA reporting and practicing in Denmark.

Such a problem can be formulated as maximizing a regularized submodular function under certain constraints. In this paper, we consider a generalized k-system constraint, which captures various requirements in real-world applications. For this problem, we propose the first streaming algorithm with provable performance bounds, leveraging a novel multitudinous distorted filter framework.

To address this gap, several ML models aim to automatically detect useful insights from charts and narrate them in a simpler textual format. However, most of these solutions can only detect basic factual insights (a.k.a. descriptive insights) that are already present in the chart, which may help with chart comprehension, but not decision-making. In this work, we study whether more advanced predictive and investigative insights can help users understand what will happen next and what actions they should take. These advanced insights can help decision-makers better understand the reasons behind anomaly events, predict future unfolding trends, and recommend possible actions for optimizing business outcomes. Through a study with 18 participants, we found that predictive and investigative insights lead to more insights recorded by users on average and better effectiveness ratings.": 0.1961205005645752

Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect). The extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of computational complexity, number of parameters, and latency measures.": 0.15050745010375977,

The Metaverse – the emerging ecosphere built upon web and internet platforms has become an integral part of the today’s digital society. Representing a new paradigm, the Metaverse is made up of virtual worlds developed in extended reality (XR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR) and augmentative reality (AR) technologies. The Metaverse has opened up a plethora of exciting opportunities in which accessibility and inclusive design are important attributes. As tech writer Julie Brehuescu recently wrote for The Drum, “One goal of the metaverse is to replicate the feeling of real-world connection by creating immersive virtual environments. But it may also make the internet more accessible to the more than one billion people who struggle to interact with digital content each day due to neurodivergence, disability or other impairments.” How can the Metaverse adapt to working and learning environments to ensure user needs are met quickly and efficiently? What solutions exist to encourage the autonomy and well-being of people with disabilities and older adults? What are the social, financial, cultural or ethical implications of deploying immersive web solutions without accessibility in mind? While we encourage authors to contribute to the conference on any of the traditional topics covered at W4A, this year we seek to provide an answer to these and other related questions by particularly welcoming submissions that address web-related challenges and/or solutions associated with the following areas": 0.18068277835845947,

He is currently completing a book manuscript, Steal this Constitution: The Drift and Mastery of Constitutional Design, which examines the design and diffusion of democratic institutions. Much of his research is on the origins and consequences of national constitutions. With Tom Ginsburg (University of Chicago), Professor Elkins co-directs both the Comparative Constitutions Project(http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/) , a NSF-funded initiative to understand the causes and consequences of constitutional choices, and the website Constitute(https://webeditor.la.utexas.edu/profile/constituteproject.org) , which provides resources and analysis for constitutional drafters in new democracies.

One solution to users’ protection is developing online moderation tools using Machine Learning (ML) techniques for automatic detection or content filtering. On the other hand, the processing of user data requires compliance with privacy policies. This paper proposes a privacy–preserving Federated Learning (FL) framework for online content moderation that incorporates Central Differential Privacy (CDP). We simulate the FL training of a classifier for detecting tweets with harmful content, and we show that the performance of the FL framework can be close to the centralized approach. Moreover, it has a high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number of tweets) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of clients (from fifty to ten) or the tweets per client (from 1K to 100), the classifier can still achieve AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to four other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior and still obtain a promising performance (61% – 80% AUC).": 0.2206704020500183

They have widespread applications in scientific innovation, creative writing, and education. The ability to discover creative analogies that are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the web is highly desirable to power all such applications dynamically and augment human creativity. Recently, Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), trained on massive Web data, have shown great promise in generating mostly known analogies that are explicitly mentioned on the Web. However, it is unclear how they could be leveraged for mining creative analogies not explicitly mentioned on the Web. We address this challenge and propose Creative Analogy Mining (CAM), a novel framework for mining creative analogies, which consists of the following three main steps: 1) Generate analogies using PLMs with effectively designed prompts, 2) Evaluate their quality using scoring functions, and 3) Refine the low-quality analogies by another round of prompt-based generation. We propose both unsupervised and supervised instantiations of the framework so that it can be used even without any annotated data. Based on human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we find that our unsupervised framework can mine 13.7% highly-creative and 56.37% somewhat-creative analogies. Moreover, our supervised scores are generally better than the unsupervised ones and correlate moderately with human evaluators, indicating that they would be even more effective at mining creative analogies. These findings also shed light on the creativity of PLMs 1.": 0.18644732236862183,

Machine Translation (MT) provides an opportunity to lift relevance by translating the Spanish queries to English before delivering them to the search engine. However, polysemy-derived problems, high latency and context scarcity in product search, make generic MT an impractical solution. The wide diversity of products in marketplaces injects non-translatable entities, loanwords, ambiguous morphemes, cross-language ambiguity and a variety of Spanish dialects in the communication between buyers and sellers, posing a thread to the accuracy of MT. In this work, we leverage domain adaptation on a simplified architecture of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to make both latency and accuracy suitable for e-commerce search. Our NMT model is fine-tuned on a mixed-domain corpus based on engagement data expanded with catalog back-translation techniques. Beyond accuracy, and given that translation is not the goal but the means to relevant results, the problem of Query Translatability is addressed by a classifier on whether the translation should be automatic or explicitly requested. We assembled these models into a query translation system that we tested and launched at Walmart.com , with a statistically significant lift in Spanish GMV and an nDCG gain for Spanish queries of +70%.": 0.18765974044799805,

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising paradigm for this goal, as it directly optimizes overall performance of sequential recommendation. However, many existing RL-based approaches induce huge computational overhead, because they require not only the recommended items but also all other candidate items to be stored. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work. With online A/B experiments on real-world RS, we confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach and the importance of modeling the two types of randomness.": 0.1915338635444641,

The proposed approach employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze linked entities in a cross-lingual knowledge graph in order to determine topic distributions for Wikipedia articles in 28 languages.

It can be used for similar products retrieval from different suppliers or duplicate products detection of one supplier. Common methods use the image as the detected object, but they only consider the visual features and overlook the attribute information contained in the textual descriptions, and perform weakly for products in image less important industries like machinery, hardware tools and electronic component, even if an additional text matching module is added. In this paper, we propose a unified vision-language modeling method for e-commerce same-style products retrieval, which is designed to represent one product with its textual descriptions and visual contents. It contains one sampling skill to collect positive pairs from user click logs with category and relevance constrained, and a novel contrastive loss unit to model the image, text, and image+text representations into one joint embedding space. It is capable of cross-modal product-to-product retrieval, as well as style transfer and user-interactive search. Offline evaluations on annotated data demonstrate its superior retrieval performance, and online testings show it can attract more clicks and conversions.

The crux of the argument lies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first the auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA or mCPA bidding format (and submit bids accordingly); and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can revisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending on the bids submitted by the bidders). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format compared to the classic mCPA format.": 0.11750483512878418,

We show that in the worst case, the approximation ratio of social welfare by running the vanilla VCG auctions with user costs could as bad as 0. To improve the performance of VCG, We propose a new variant of VCG based on properly chosen cost multipliers, and prove that there exist auction-dependent and bidder-dependent cost multipliers that guarantee approximation ratios of 1/2 and 1/4 respectively in terms of the social welfare.": 0.13193386793136597

This method can achieve either (1), (3) and (4), or (2), (3) and (4) in the binary effort setting. In this paper, we suggest using a rank-order payment function (tournament). Assuming Gaussian noise, we analytically optimize the rank-order payment function, and identify a sufficient statistic, sensitivity, which serves as a metric for optimizing the performance measurements. This helps us obtain (1), (2) and (3) simultaneously.

First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale.": 0.18072152137756348,

In classic auction theory, only the auctioneer (i.e., the platform) and buyers (i.e., the advertisers) are involved, while the advertising audiences are ignored. For ecommerce advertising, however, the platform can provide coupons for the advertising audiences and nudge them into purchasing more products at lower prices (e.g., 2 dollars off the regular price). Such promotions can lead to an increase in amount and value of purchases. In this paper, we jointly design the coupon value computation, slot allocation, and payment of online advertising in an auto-bidding world. Firstly, we propose the auction mechanism, named CFA-auction (i.e., Coupon-For-the-Audiences-auction), which takes advertising audiences into account in the auction design. We prove the existence of pacing equilibrium, and show that CFA-auction satisfies the IC (incentive compatibility), IR (individual rationality) constraints. Then, we study the optimality of CFA-auction, and prove it can maintain an approximation of the optimal. Finally, experimental evaluation results on both offline dataset as well as online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CFA-auction.": 0.13603097200393677

We also show that, under some mild conditions, the auctioneer’s revenue is larger when the bidder uses the tCPA format rather than mCPA.

However, existing explainability techniques often require dedicated backend servers, which limit their usefulness as the Web community moves toward in-browser ML for lower latency and greater privacy. To address the pressing need for a client-side explainability solution, we present WebSHAP, the first in-browser tool that adapts the state-of-the-art model-agnostic explainability technique SHAP to the Web environment. Our open-source tool is developed with modern Web technologies such as WebGL that leverage client-side hardware capabilities and make it easy to integrate into existing Web ML applications. We demonstrate WebSHAP in a usage scenario of explaining ML-based loan approval decisions to loan applicants. Reflecting on our work, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for future research on transparent Web ML. WebSHAP is available at https://github.com/poloclub/webshap.": 0.15546691417694092,

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment. Finally, we analyze token smart contracts to identify mechanisms that can hinder sniper bots.": 0.09535300731658936,

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving. Understanding the global landscape surrounding tax evasion opportunities in decentralized finance represents a first step at preventing corporate capital flight of cryptocurrencies.": 0.1391698122024536,

Assuming Gaussian noise, we analytically optimize the rank-order payment function, and identify a sufficient statistic, sensitivity, which serves as a metric for optimizing the performance measurements.

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing. Finally, crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.": 0.16909241676330566,

This paper presents a novel model called xGCN for large-scale network embedding, which is a practical solution for link predictions. xGCN addresses these issues by encoding graph-structure data in an extreme convolutional manner, and has the potential to push the performance of network embedding-based link predictions to a new record. Specifically, instead of assigning each node with a directly learnable embedding vector, xGCN regards node embeddings as static features. It uses a propagation operation to smooth node embeddings and relies on a Refinement neural Network (RefNet) to transform the coarse embeddings derived from the unsupervised propagation into new ones that optimize a training objective. The output of RefNet, which are well-refined embeddings, will replace the original node embeddings. This process is repeated iteratively until the model converges to a satisfying status. Experiments on three social network datasets with link prediction tasks show that xGCN not only achieves the best accuracy compared with a series of competitive baselines but also is highly efficient and scalable.": 0.15019267797470093,

Learning more informative multimodal representation often relies on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult and unrealistic to obtain. To learn informative multimodal representation on limited labeled datasets as more as possible, we proposed TMMDA for MSA, a new Token Mixup Multimodal Data Augmentation, which first generates new virtual modalities from the mixed token-level representation of raw modalities, and then enhances the representation of raw modalities by utilizing the representation of the generated virtual modalities. To preserve semantics during virtual modality generation, we propose a novel cross-modal token mixup strategy based on the generative adversarial network. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, verify the superiority of our model compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment.

One of the prominent auto-bidding formats is that of target cost-per-acquisition (tCPA) which maximizes the volume of conversions subject to a return-of-investment constraint. From an auction theoretic perspective however, this trend seems to go against foundational results that postulate that for profit-maximizing (aka quasi-linear) bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like marginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA.": 0.1431330442428589,

The crux of the argument lies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first the auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA or mCPA bidding format (and submit bids accordingly); and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can revisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending on the bids submitted by the bidders). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format compared to the classic mCPA format.": 0.14412593841552734,

Citation metrics are universally used methods to evaluate researchers. Amongst the several variations of citation metrics, the h-index proposed by Hirsch has become the leading measure. Recent work shows that h-index is not an effective measure to determine scientific impact - due to changing authorship patterns. This can be mitigated by using h-index of a paper to compute h-index of an author. We show that using fractional allocation of h-index gives better results. In this work, we reapply two indices based on the h-index of a single paper. The indices are referred to as: hp-index and hp-frac-index. We run large-scale experiments in three different fields with about a million publications and 3,000 authors. Our experiments show that hp-frac-index provides a unique ranking when compared to h-index. It also performs better than h-index in providing higher ranks to the awarded researcher.": 0.10178720951080322,

These KGs can be used as the basis for dataset search engines, saving researchers time and supporting them in finding new connections. We collected textual data and used several modern natural language processing (NLP) methods to create the nodes and the edges of the KGs.

In this paper, we first point out the three drawbacks of existing similarity-based embedding methods: inaccurate similarity computation, conflicting optimization goal, and impairing in/out-degree distributions. Then, motivated by these drawbacks, we propose AdaSim*, a novel similarity measure for graphs that is conducive to the similarity-based graph embedding. We finally propose GELTOR, an effective embedding method that employs AdaSim* as a node similarity measure and the concept of learning-to-rank in the embedding process. Contrary to existing methods, GELTOR does not learn the similarity scores distribution; instead, for any target node, GELTOR conforms the ranks of its top-t similar nodes in the embedding space to their original ranks based on AdaSim* scores. We conduct extensive experiments with six real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of GELTOR in graph reconstruction, link prediction, and node classification tasks. Our experimental results show that (1) AdaSim* outperforms AdaSim, RWR, and MCT in computing nodes similarity in graphs, (2) our GETLOR outperforms existing state-of-the-arts and conventional embedding methods in most cases of the above machine learning tasks, thereby implying that learning-to-rank is beneficial to graph embedding.": 0.1684381365776062

        "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_5>>abstract>>Analogies inspire creative solutions to problems, and facilitate the creative expression of ideas and the explanation of complex concepts. They have widespread applications in scientific innovation, creative writing, and education. The ability to discover creative analogies that are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the web is highly desirable to power all such applications dynamically and augment human creativity. Recently, Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), trained on massive Web data, have shown great promise in generating mostly known analogies that are explicitly mentioned on the Web. However, it is unclear how they could be leveraged for mining creative analogies not explicitly mentioned on the Web. We address this challenge and propose Creative Analogy Mining (CAM), a novel framework for mining creative analogies, which consists of the following three main steps: 1) Generate analogies using PLMs with effectively designed prompts, 2) Evaluate their quality using scoring functions, and 3) Refine the low-quality analogies by another round of prompt-based generation. We propose both unsupervised and supervised instantiations of the framework so that it can be used even without any annotated data. Based on human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we find that our unsupervised framework can mine 13.7% highly-creative and 56.37% somewhat-creative analogies. Moreover, our supervised scores are generally better than the unsupervised ones and correlate moderately with human evaluators, indicating that they would be even more effective at mining creative analogies. These findings also shed light on the creativity of PLMs 1.": 0.17694807052612305,
