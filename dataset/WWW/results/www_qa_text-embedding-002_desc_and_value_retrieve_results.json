We especially encourage submissions that propose novel and principled techniques or algorithms that can leverage the special characteristics of the Web, social media, and user behaviors for such extraction and mining. In addition to new techniques and algorithms, we also seek insights gained from the mining process.\nThe major focus of the Web Conference is to address the key challenges of Web-related scientific research. The general theme of the Web conference this year is “Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility​​”. We particularly welcome submissions that align with this theme. Submissions that merely use one or another Web artifact — e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network — rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope of the conference and will be rejected early during the reviewing process.\nPlease note that any submission for the track must make clear the relevance of the paper to the World Wide Web.

(QA) systems that can instantly answer almost all their questions, saving users search time and increasing the throughput and precision in the applied domain. A vast amount of work is being carried out in QA systems to deliver better content satisfying users’ information needs [2]. Since QA systems are ascending the cycle of emerging technologies, there are potential research gaps that can be explored. QA systems form a significant part of Conversational Artificial Intelligent systems giving rise to a new research pathway, i.e., Conversational Question Answering (CQA) systems [32]. We propose to design and develop a CQA system leveraging Hypergraph-based techniques. The approach focuses on the multi-turn conversation and multi-context to gauge users’ exact information needs and deliver better answers. We further aim to address \"supporting evidence-based retrieval\" for fact-based responsible answer generation.

The interaction-based modeling between the query and the item has been widely validated to be useful for the ranking stage, where more computation cost is affordable. Here, we are quite initerested in an demanding question: how to exploiting query-item interaction-based learning to enhance candidate retrieval and still maintain the low computation cost. Note that an item usually contain various heteorgeneous attributes which could help us understand the item characteristics more precisely. To this end, we propose a novel attribute guided representation learning framework (named AGREE) to enhance the candidate retrieval by exploiting query-attribute relevance. The key idea is to couple the query and item representation learning together during the training phase, but also enable easy decoupling for efficient inference. Specifically, we introduce an attribute fusion layer in the item side to identify most relevant item features for item representation. On the query side, an attribute-aware learning process is introduced to better infer the search intent also from these attributes. After model training, we then decouple the attribute information away from the query encoder, which guarantees the low latency for the inference phase. Extensive experiments over two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AGREE against several state-of-the-art technical alternatives. Further online A/B test from AliPay search servise also show that AGREE achieves substantial performance gain over four business metrics. Currently, the proposed AGREE has been deployed online in AliPay for serving major traffic.": 0.16245248317718505}, "What is the title of the paper written by Emyn Dean for the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call for Nominations for the Seoul Test of Time Award of The ACM Web Conference 2023>>conferenceName>>The ACM Web Conference 2023": 0.12084841728210449, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_17>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583543": 0.12444310188293457, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583210": 0.12692614793777468, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587302": 0.13006142377853394, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_8>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583400": 0.1301198363304138, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_25>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583375": 0.13128033876419065, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Keynotes>>SESSION: Keynotes_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3593048": 0.13164119720458983, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_37>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583457": 0.13173950910568238}, "What neural network technique was used in Victoria Firsanova's research for building a mobile app for people on the spectrum?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_1>>abstract>>The inclusion of autistic people can be augmented by a mobile app that provides information without a human mediator making information perception more liberating for people in the spectrum.

Existing proposals, however, are subject to adversarial ownership forgery (e.g., methods based on watermarks or fingerprints) or require full access to the original training dataset for ownership verification (e.g., methods requiring the replay of the learning process). In this paper, we propose a novel Provenance of Training (PoT) scheme, the first empirical study towards verifying DNN model ownership without accessing any original dataset while being robust against existing attacks. At its core, PoT relies on a coherent model chain built from the intermediate checkpoints saved during model training to serve as the ownership certificate. Through an in-depth analysis of model training, we propose six key properties that a legitimate model chain shall naturally hold. In contrast, it is difficult for the adversary to forge a model chain that satisfies these properties simultaneously without performing actual training.

From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.": 0.18938126564025878, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Security, Privacy & Trust Track>>Topics>>Topics_15>>Security in Web-based applications and services": 0.1976142883300781}, "In the BERT4ETH: A Pre-trained Transformer for Ethereum Fraud Detection study, what were some of the serious vulnerabilities found?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_21>>title>>BERT4ETH: A Pre-trained Transformer for Ethereum Fraud Detection": 0.17603759765625, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_26>>abstract>>As various forms of fraud proliferate on Ethereum, it is imperative to safeguard against these malicious activities to protect susceptible users from being victimized.

To address these challenges, we propose BERT4ETH, a universal pre-trained Transformer encoder that serves as an account representation extractor for detecting various fraud behaviors on Ethereum. BERT4ETH features the superior modeling capability of Transformer to capture the dynamic sequential patterns inherent in Ethereum transactions, and addresses the challenges of pre-training a BERT model for Ethereum with three practical and effective strategies, namely repetitiveness reduction, skew alleviation and heterogeneity modeling.

However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations. We demonstrate our automated approach on several large ontologies from the oceanographic domain and show its agreement with a manual evaluation by domain experts and its superiority over the state-of-the-art.": 0.1709873080253601, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>TheWebConf 2023 Research Tracks Final Call For Papers (CFP) 'Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility'>>Instructions for authors of research tracks submissions>>Focus>>A typical Web Conference paper should have explicit focus on one of the following:": 0.17882767915725706}, "Which paper talks about the conversion of Legal Agreements into Smart Legal Contracts using NLP?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_1>>abstract>>A Smart Legal Contract (SLC) is a specialized digital agreement comprising natural language and computable components.

To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality.

Last year the workshop was held virtually in Lyon, France. The workshop series aims to investigate the Web and Web applications’ role in establishing smart city (SC) promises. The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing.

The smart city hub (SCHub) introduces a new concept that aims to homogenize data, service, human and material flows in cities. A proof of concept is based on non-typical data flows, like the ones that are collected by biotechnological activities, like Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally. Most of the diet related NCDs are related to the gut microbiome, the microbial community that resides in our gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance or loss of microbiome diversity is one of the main factors leading to NCDs by affecting various functions, including energy metabolism, intestinal permeability, and brain function. Gut dysbiosis is reflected in altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by the gut microbiota. A microcapsule system can play the role of a sensor that collects data from the local community and transmits it to the SCHub in order for the doctors to receive the appropriate patients information and define the appropriate treatment method; for the city to process anonymized information and measure community's health in diet terms. A prototype with a biosensor that correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacities is presented in this paper, together with the use-case scenario that engages the SCHub.": 0.18191075325012207, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 9th WebAndTheCity -The Web and Smart Cities>>SESSION: Workshop: 9th WebAndTheCity -The Web and Smart Cities_1>>title>>WebAndTheCity'23: 9th International Workshop on The Web and Smart Cities": 0.18608756065368653}, "What is the unique feature of the web-based application presented in the paper titled 'Towards a Sustainability Index Calculator for Smart Cities'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 9th WebAndTheCity -The Web and Smart Cities>>SESSION: Workshop: 9th WebAndTheCity -The Web and Smart Cities_4>>abstract>>In this era of rapid urbanization and our endeavors to create more smart cities, it's crucial to keep track of how our society and neighborhood are getting impacted. It is important to make conscious decisions to keep harmony in sustainability. There are multiple frameworks to evaluate how sustainability is measured and to understand how sustainable a place is, be it a city or a region, and one such framework is the Circles of Sustainability. Though these frameworks offer good solutions, it is a challenge to collect relevant data to make the framework widely usable. This paper focuses on this specific issue by utilizing the methodology introduced in the framework and applying it practically to better understand how sustainable our cities and society are. We present a unique web-based application which utilizes publicly accessible data to compute sustainability scores and rank for every city and presents the results in an intelligent and easy to comprehend visual interface. The paper also discusses the technical difficulties associated with creating such an application, including data collection, data processing, data integration, and scoring algorithm.

However, the complexity of fairness definitions and the proliferation of fairness metrics in research literature have led to a complex decision-making space. This environment makes it challenging for practitioners to operationalize and pick metrics that work within their unique context. This suggests that practitioners require more decision-making support, but it is not clear what type of support would be beneficial. We conducted a literature review of 24 papers to gather metrics introduced by the research community for measuring fairness in recommendation and ranking systems. We organized these metrics into a ‘decision-tree style’ support framework designed to help practitioners scope fairness objectives and identify fairness metrics relevant to their recommendation domain and application context. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using this framework to assess which challenges practitioners may face when scoping fairness objectives and metrics for their system, and which further support may be needed beyond such tools.": 0.13581284284591677, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_344>>title>>Scoping Fairness Objectives and Identifying Fairness Metrics for Recommender Systems: The Practitioners’ Perspective": 0.147406268119812}, "What is the main issue addressed in the paper 'Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)_10>>title>>Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations": 0.15824347734451294, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_351>>title>>Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations": 0.17015920877456664, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_10>>title>>Fairly Adaptive Negative Sampling for Recommendations": 0.17338912487030028, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_5>>title>>On the Theories Behind Hard Negative Sampling for Recommendation": 0.17513561248779297, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems_2>>abstract>>Recently, there has been an increasing adoption of differential privacy guided algorithms for privacy-preserving machine learning tasks. However, the use of such algorithms comes with trade-offs in terms of algorithmic fairness, which has been widely acknowledged. Specifically, we have empirically observed that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn, causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive users. To address the above issues, we propose DP-Fair, a two-stage framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations. The experimental results, based on Amazon datasets, and user history logs collected from Etsy, one of the largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of both overall accuracy and user group fairness on both shallow and deep recommendation models compared to vanilla DP-SGD.": 0.17959971427917482, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_76>>title>>On the Theories Behind Hard Negative Sampling for Recommendation": 0.18150357007980347}, "Which paper looks into the issue of plagiarism in language models?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web (new track)_2>>title>>Do Language Models Plagiarize?": 0.15519036054611204, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_7>>abstract>>An information gap exists across Wikipedia’s language editions, with a considerable proportion of articles available in only a few languages.

Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system. Typing errors make the problem even more challenging. Streaming services uses spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features to address this issue up to certain extent.

This problem is aggravated when there is no behavioral data available for new content. Poor quality recommendation for these items lead to user dissatisfaction and short content shelf-life. In this paper we propose a solution MEMER (Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations), that utilises the multimodal semantic information of content and uses it to generate better quality embeddings for early-stage items. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by extending it to various explicit and implicit user actions. Using these learnt embeddings, we conduct offline and online experiments to verify its effectiveness. The predicted embeddings show significant gains in online early-stage experiments for both videos and images (videos:  44% relative gain in click through rate,  46% relative gain in explicit engagements,  9% relative gain in successful video play,  20% relative reduction in skips, images:  56% relative gain in explicit engagements).

An entity can be a person, organization, work-of-art, etc., while an event, such as the Opioid epidemic, occurs at specific point(s) in time. ELTE first extracts key-phrases from episode title and description metadata. It then uses entity linking to canonicalize them against Wikipedia knowledge base (KB), ensuring that the topics exist in the real world.

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing.

Standard click propensity estimation techniques rely on simple models of user browsing behavior that primarily account for the attributes of the presentation context that affect whether the relevance of an item to the search context is observed. Most notably, the inherent effect of the listwise presentation of the items on users’ propensity for engagement is captured in the position of the presented items on the search result page. In this work, we enrich this position bias based click propensity model by proposing an observation model that further incorporates the underlying search intent, as reflected in the user’s click pattern in the search context. Our approach does not require an intent prediction model based on the content of the search context. Instead, we rely on a simple, yet effective, non-causal estimate of the user’s browsing intent from the number of click events in the search context. We empirically characterize the distinct rank decay patterns of the estimated click propensities in the characterized intent classes. In particular, we demonstrate a sharper decay of click propensities in top ranks for the intent class identified by sparse user clicks and the higher likelihood of observing clicks in lower ranks for the intent class identified by higher number of user clicks.

Assuming Gaussian noise, we analytically optimize the rank-order payment function, and identify a sufficient statistic, sensitivity, which serves as a metric for optimizing the performance measurements.

Our confidence ranking loss allows direct optimization of the logits output for different convex surrogate functions of metrics, e.g. AUC and Accuracy depending on the target task and dataset.

However, these knowledge graphs are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model.

Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign. Our findings broaden the field of crowd-aware system design and inform discussions about the augmentation of traditional financing systems with tech innovations.": 0.16974046230316162}, "Who are the track chairs for the 'Web and Society Track' at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Track name>>Web and Society Track": 0.11947894096374512, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Contact>>websoc-thewebconf2023@easychair.org": 0.12422157526016235, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>GENERAL CHAIRS>>contact>>chairs2023@thewebconf.org": 0.12474291324615479, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Conference>>The Web Conference": 0.12580747604370118, "WWW2023>>calls>>Special Track>>CFP: Web4Good (Sustainable Development and Vulnerable Populations)>>You can reach the track chairs at>>www2023-web-for-good@easychair.org.": 0.12685123682022095, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>PROGRAM COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRS>>contact>>pc-chairs2023@thewebconf.org": 0.12895514965057372, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.12950432300567627, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>WORKSHOP CHAIRS>>contact>>workshop2023@thewebconf.org": 0.1322237253189087, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>TheWebConf 2023 Research Tracks Final Call For Papers (CFP) 'Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility'>>Instructions for authors of research tracks submissions>>Contact>>You can reach the chairs at: pc-chairs2023@thewebconf.org": 0.1323093891143799, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>PROCEEDINGS CHAIRS>>contact>>proceedings2023@thewebconf.org": 0.13571449518203735, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops_1>>title>>Workshops at the Web Conference 2023": 0.13636080026626587, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>SPECIAL TRACK: WEB4GOOD>>contact>>web4good2023@thewebconf.org": 0.13709714412689208}, "What is the primary focus of the 'Web and Society Track' at the WWW2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Description>>The Web deeply impacts and co-evolves with societies worldwide.

In this paper, we propose a multi-step process to achieve the same. First, we explore the semantic sentence segmentation of SEBI case files via classification. We also propose a dataset of Indian legal adjudicating orders which contain tags from carefully crafted domain-specific sentence categories with the help of legal experts.

Many methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks. However, most of the current methods present one or more of the following problems: (i) They only consider fact triplets, while ignoring the ontology information of knowledge graphs. (ii) The obtained embeddings do not contain much semantic information. Therefore, using these embeddings for semantic tasks is problematic. (iii) They do not enable large-scale training. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the ontology of knowledge graphs and partitions the knowledge graph based on classes to include more semantic information for parallel training of large-scale knowledge graph embeddings.

We propose an anomaly detection approach based on network analysis to help AFC officers navigating through the high load of information that is typical of AFC data-driven scenarios. By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network metrics that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the metric-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system.

Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains. This will enable us to in the future explore what existing knowledge can be adapted or used to develop ontologies for circular value networks.": 0.14424000978469848, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability - KG4S>>SESSION: Workshop: The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability - KG4S_1>>title>>The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability – KG4S Foreword": 0.1846590518951416}, "What is the name of the Knowledge Graph being built to store relevant data about Environmental Assessment reporting and practice in Denmark?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability - KG4S>>SESSION: Workshop: The First International Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Sustainability - KG4S_1>>abstract>>An environmental assessment (EA) report describes and assesses the environmental impact of a series of activities involved in the development of a project.

To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

However, most existing visualization recommendation systems focus on ranking all possible visualizations based on the attributes or encodings, which makes it difficult to find the most relevant insights. We therefore introduce a novel class of insight-based visualization recommendation systems that automatically rank and recommend groups of related insights as well as the most important insights within each group. Our approach combines results from different learning-based methods to discover insights automatically and generalizes to a variety of attribute types (e.g., categorical, numerical, and temporal), including non-trivial combinations of these attribute types. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we implemented a insight-centric visualization recommendation system, SpotLight, and conducted a user study with twelve participants, which showed that users are able to quickly find and understand relevant insights in unfamiliar data.": 0.1897299885749817, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_19>>abstract>>Many people find it difficult to comprehend basic charts on the web, let alone make effective decisions from them. To address this gap, several ML models aim to automatically detect useful insights from charts and narrate them in a simpler textual format. However, most of these solutions can only detect basic factual insights (a.k.a. descriptive insights) that are already present in the chart, which may help with chart comprehension, but not decision-making. In this work, we study whether more advanced predictive and investigative insights can help users understand what will happen next and what actions they should take. These advanced insights can help decision-makers better understand the reasons behind anomaly events, predict future unfolding trends, and recommend possible actions for optimizing business outcomes. Through a study with 18 participants, we found that predictive and investigative insights lead to more insights recorded by users on average and better effectiveness ratings.": 0.19389712810516357, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_5>>title>>SpotLight: Visual Insight Recommendation": 0.19520878791809082}, "What is the Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering that the project 'C-Affinity: A Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering' propose?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_10>>title>>C-Affinity: A Novel Similarity Measure for Effective Data Clustering": 0.16464291810989382, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_10>>abstract>>Clustering is widely employed in various applications as it is one of the most useful data mining techniques. In performing clustering, a similarity measure, which defines how similar a pair of data objects are, plays an important role. A similarity measure is employed by considering a target dataset’s characteristics. Current similarity measures (or distances) do not reflect the distribution of data objects in a dataset at all. From the clustering point of view, this fact may limit the clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose c-affinity, a new notion of a similarity measure that reflects the distribution of objects in the given dataset from a clustering point of view. We design c-affinity between any two objects to have a higher value as they are more likely to belong to the same cluster by learning the data distribution. We use random walk with restart (RWR) on the k-nearest neighbor graph of the given dataset to measure (1) how similar a pair of objects are and (2) how densely other objects are distributed between them. Via extensive experiments on sixteen synthetic and real-world datasets, we verify that replacing the existing similarity measure with our c-affinity improves the clustering accuracy significantly.": 0.18280755281448363}, "What approach does the project 'Measuring Potential Performance Gains of Python Web Applications with pyUpgradeSim' use to measure the performance of OSS projects?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_42>>abstract>>Python is a popular programming language for web development.

Even though three years have passed, the world continues to struggle with the virus. Concerns are growing about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of infected individuals, who are more likely to experience depression, which can have long-lasting consequences for both the affected individuals and the world. Detection and intervention at an early stage can reduce the risk of depression in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between COVID-19 infection and depression through social media analysis. Firstly, we managed a dataset of COVID-19 patients that contains information about their social media activity both before and after infection. Secondly, We conducted an extensive analysis of this dataset to investigate the characteristic of COVID-19 patients with a higher risk of depression. Thirdly, we proposed a deep neural network for early prediction of depression risk. This model considers daily mood swings as a psychiatric signal and incorporates textual and emotional characteristics via knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in detecting depression risk, with an AUROC of 0.9317 and an AUPRC of 0.8116.

Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)_5>>abstract>>Locating and characterizing polarization is one of the most important issues to enable a healthier web ecosystem. Finding groups of nodes that form strongly stable agreements and participate in collective conflicts with other groups is an important problem in this context. Previous works approach this problem by finding balanced subgraphs, in which the polarity measure is optimized, that result in large subgraphs without a clear notion of agreement or conflict. In real-world signed networks, balanced subgraphs are often not polarized as in the case of a subgraph with only positive edges. To remedy this issue, we leverage the notion of cohesion — we find pairs of cohesively polarized communities where each node in a community is positively connected to nodes in the same community and negatively connected to nodes in the other community. To capture the cohesion along with the polarization, we define a new measure, dichotomy. We leverage the balanced triangles, which model the cohesion and polarization at the same time, to design a heuristic that results in good seedbeds for polarized communities in real-world signed networks. Then, we introduce the electron decomposition which finds cohesively polarized communities with high dichotomy score. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method finds cohesively polarized communities and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to several measures. Moreover, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing methods and practical for large-scale networks.": 0.1874194025993347}, "What insights did the research paper titled 'Towards Automated Detection of Risky Images Shared by Youth on Social Media' provide?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)_7>>title>>Towards Automated Detection of Risky Images Shared by Youth on Social Media": 0.16387735605239867, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)_6>>abstract>>With the growing ubiquity of the Internet and access to media-based social media platforms, the risks associated with media content sharing on social media and the need for safety measures against such risks have grown paramount. At the same time, risk is highly contextualized, especially when it comes to media content youth share privately on social media. In this work, we conducted qualitative content analyses on risky media content flagged by youth participants and research assistants of similar ages to explore contextual dimensions of youth online risks. The contextual risk dimensions were then used to inform semi- and self-supervised state-of-the-art vision transformers to automate the process of identifying risky images shared by youth. We found that vision transformers are capable of learning complex image features for use in automated risk detection and classification. The results of our study serve as a foundation for designing contextualized and youth-centered machine-learning methods for automated online risk detection.": 0.17307499647140503}, "What was the main finding of the study 'Learned Temporal Aggregations for Fraud Classification on E-Commerce Platforms'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)_9>>title>>Learned Temporal Aggregations for Fraud Classification on E-Commerce Platforms": 0.1567464590072632, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: Fourth International Workshop on Cyber Social Threats (CySoc 2023)_8>>abstract>>Fraud and other types of adversarial behavior are serious problems on customer-to-customer (C2C) e-commerce platforms, where harmful behaviors by bad actors erode user trust and safety. Many modern e-commerce integrity systems utilize machine learning (ML) to detect fraud and bad actors. We discuss the practical problems faced by integrity systems which utilize data associated with user interactions with the platform. Specifically, we focus on the challenge of representing the user interaction events, and aggregating their features. We compare the performance of two paradigms to handle the feature temporality when training the ML models: hand-engineered temporal aggregation and a learned aggregation using a sequence encoder. We show that a model which learns a time-aggregation using a sequence encoder outperforms models trained on handcrafted aggregations on the fraud classification task with a real-world dataset.":

Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_22>>abstract>>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful models to handle graph data and can achieve state-of-the-art in many critical tasks including node classification and link prediction. However, existing graph neural networks still face both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing based on previous literature. To this end, we propose a new Curvature-based topology-aware Dropout sampling technique named CurvDrop, in which we integrate the Discrete Ricci Curvature into graph neural networks to enable more expressive graph models. Also, this work can improve graph neural networks by quantifying connections in graphs and using structural information such as community structures in graphs. As a result, our method can tackle the both challenges of over-smoothing and over-squashing with theoretical justification. Also, numerous experiments on public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

The over centralisation of data on the web, however, has been raised as a concern by a number of prominent researchers in the field. For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved? These questions and others are addressed in this workshop.": 0.11351689100265502, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_4>>abstract>>Increasing interest in decentralisation for data and processing on the Web brings with it the need to re-examine methods for verifying data and behaviour for scalable multi-party interactions.

It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). We implemented our approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric.": 0.17672232389450074}, "What is the proposed solution to privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics in the paper by Audrey Ekuban and John Domingue?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>We welcome submissions that address the broad goals of this Research Track, and look forward to seeing the diverse ways in which authors will approach these themes>>EthicalLegalAspectsDataAnalysis>>Ethical and legal aspects of web-scale data analysis": 0.1500923991203308, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_5>>title>>Towards Decentralised Learning Analytics (Positioning Paper)": 0.16068732738494873, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)>>SESSION: Workshop: Trusting Decentralised Knowledge Graphs and Web Data (TrusDeKW)_5>>abstract>>When students interact with an online course, the routes they take when navigating through the course can be captured. Learning Analytics is the process of measuring, collecting, recording, and analysing this Student Activity Data. Predictive Learning Analytics, a sub-field of Learning Analytics, can help to identify students who are at risk of dropping out or failing, as well as students who are close to a grade boundary. Course tutors can use the insights provided by the analyses to offer timely assistance to these students. Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.": 0.16294095516204835}, "What is the main goal of the 'Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track' at the 32nd edition of The Web Conference series?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Description>>We invite research contributions to the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track at the 32nd edition of The Web Conference series (formerly known as WWW), to be hosted at Austin, TX, US, on April 30 - May 4, 2023.": 0.09101552963256836, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Goal>>The goal of this track is to gather researchers and developers from academia, industry, and civil society to present and debate methods for achieving a Web that is inclusive, just, ethical, and open.": 0.09154572486877441, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Track name>>Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track": 0.09885150194168091, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>ResearchFocus>>As part of this research track, we invite a wide range of research studies concerned with the fairness and equity, justice, inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and ethics of web infrastructure, systems, and ecosystems.": 0.10502690076828003, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web Track>>Contributions>>To achieve this, we look for contributions that describe research results, tools, audits, frameworks, design techniques and experiments that are being developed to deal with fairness and equity, accountability, and transparency, broader social impact, and ethics on the Web.

representation. This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text.

Even though three years have passed, the world continues to struggle with the virus. Concerns are growing about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of infected individuals, who are more likely to experience depression, which can have long-lasting consequences for both the affected individuals and the world. Detection and intervention at an early stage can reduce the risk of depression in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between COVID-19 infection and depression through social media analysis. Firstly, we managed a dataset of COVID-19 patients that contains information about their social media activity both before and after infection. Secondly, We conducted an extensive analysis of this dataset to investigate the characteristic of COVID-19 patients with a higher risk of depression. Thirdly, we proposed a deep neural network for early prediction of depression risk. This model considers daily mood swings as a psychiatric signal and incorporates textual and emotional characteristics via knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in detecting depression risk, with an AUROC of 0.9317 and an AUPRC of 0.8116. Our model has the potential to enable public health organizations to initiate prompt intervention with high-risk patients.": 0.18645319938659666, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_78>>authors>>authors_9>>Xiangyu Zhao and Yongfeng Zhang": 0.1931224226951599, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_350>>authors>>authors_7>>Yunjun Gao and Xing Xie": 0.19390465021133424, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_208>>authors>>authors_5>>Xingliang Yuan and Chunyang Chen": 0.1940772175788879, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_42>>authors>>authors_6>>Qingwen Liu and Xiaoyi Zeng": 0.19490981101989746, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_48>>authors>>authors_6>>Yijun Liu and Guidong Zheng": 0.19603265523910524}, "What is the title of the paper by the authors Simona Corciulo, Livio Bioglio, Valerio Basile, Viviana Patti and Rossana Damiano in 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_1>>title>>2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)": 0.09723955392837524, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_3>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587649": 0.13653395175933838, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>abstract>>We evaluate the performance of five multi-class classification models for the task of sensory recognition and introduce the DEEP Sensorium (Deep Engaging Experiences and Practices -

It can be used for similar products retrieval from different suppliers or duplicate products detection of one supplier. Common methods use the image as the detected object, but they only consider the visual features and overlook the attribute information contained in the textual descriptions, and perform weakly for products in image less important industries like machinery, hardware tools and electronic component, even if an additional text matching module is added. In this paper, we propose a unified vision-language modeling method for e-commerce same-style products retrieval, which is designed to represent one product with its textual descriptions and visual contents. It contains one sampling skill to collect positive pairs from user click logs with category and relevance constrained, and a novel contrastive loss unit to model the image, text, and image+text representations into one joint embedding space. It is capable of cross-modal product-to-product retrieval, as well as style transfer and user-interactive search. Offline evaluations on annotated data demonstrate its superior retrieval performance, and online testings show it can attract more clicks and conversions.

Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect).

We show that there exist sublinear query and time algorithms for testing three key properties of signed graphs: balance (or 2-clusterability), clusterability and signed triangle freeness. We consider both the dense graph model, where one queries the adjacency matrix entries of a signed graph, and the bounded-degree model, where one queries for the neighbors of a node and the sign of the connecting edge. Our algorithms use a variety of tools from unsigned graph property testing, as well as reductions from one setting to the other. Our main technical contribution is a sublinear algorithm for testing clusterability in the bounded-degree model. This contrasts with the property of k-clusterability in unsigned graphs, which is not testable with a sublinear number of queries in the bounded-degree model.

Most of the existing methods essentially optimize a Frobenius-like distance or ranking-based loss, ignoring the underlying geometry of graph data. Optimal transport (OT), together with Wasserstein distance, has emerged to be a powerful approach accounting for the underlying geometry explicitly. Promising as it might be, the state-of-the-art OT-based alignment methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) effectiveness due to the insufficient use of topology and consistency information and (2) scalability due to the non-convex formulation and repeated computationally costly loss calculation. In this paper, we propose a position-aware regularized optimal transport framework for network alignment named PARROT. To tackle the effectiveness issue, the proposed PARROT captures topology information by random walk with restart, with three carefully designed consistency regularization terms. To tackle the scalability issue, the regularized OT problem is decomposed into a series of convex subproblems and can be efficiently solved by the proposed constrained proximal point method with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves significant improvements in both effectiveness and scalability, outperforming the state-of-the-art network alignment methods and speeding up

"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_6>>abstract>>With the advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, virtual displays have become integral to how museums, galleries, and other tourist destinations present their collections to the public. However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations. Through multimodal interaction, we aim to encourage innovation on the Web and create more visually appealing and engaging virtual displays.

Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods. We conclude with the transferability and robustness of our approach to identify creative harmful memes.": 0.13994346857070922}, "Who are the authors of the research named 'SA-Fusion: Multimodal Fusion Approach for Web-based Human-Computer Interaction in the Wild' at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_3>>title>>SA-Fusion: Multimodal Fusion Approach for Web-based Human-Computer Interaction in the Wild": 0.1360838770866394, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)>>SESSION: Workshop: 2nd International Workshop on Multisensory Data and Knowledge (MDK)_2>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587631": 0.1469925045967102, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: The Creative Web>>SESSION: The Creative Web_3>>abstract>>Web-based AR technology has broadened human-computer interaction scenes from traditional mechanical devices and flat screens to the real world, resulting in unconstrained environmental challenges such as complex backgrounds, extreme illumination, depth range differences, and hand-object interaction. The previous hand detection and 3D hand pose estimation methods are usually based on single modality such as RGB or depth data, which are not available in some scenarios in unconstrained environments due to the differences between the two modalities. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal fusion approach, named Scene-Adapt Fusion (SA-Fusion), which can fully utilize the complementarity of RGB and depth modalities in web-based HCI tasks. SA-Fusion can be applied in existing hand detection and 3D hand pose estimation frameworks to boost their performance, and can be further integrated into the prototyping AR system to construct a web-based interactive AR application for unconstrained environments. To evaluate the proposed multimodal fusion method, we conduct two user studies on CUG Hand and DexYCB dataset, to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of accurately detecting hand and estimating 3D hand pose in unconstrained environments and hand-object interaction.": 0.14833849668502808, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583190": 0.1500951647758484}, "Who are the authors of the paper 'Code Recommendation for Open Source Software Developers' presented at the ACM Web Conference 2023, and what are their main findings?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587302": 0.16013362407684326, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_17>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583543": 0.1602702856063843, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583210": 0.1610430717468262, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_8>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583400": 0.16132118701934814, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_23>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583277": 0.16249477863311768, "WWW2023>>calls>>PhD Symposium>>Submission Guidelines>>publication>>Selected papers will be published in the Companion Proceedings of The Web Conference 2023 and made available through the ACM Digital Library.": 0.16252490282058715, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Special Track: The Creative Web>>SESSION: Special Track: The Creative Web_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587315": 0.1630178451538086, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_54>>title>>Code Recommendation for Open Source Software Developers": 0.16317201852798463, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_13>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583468": 0.1635146141052246}, "What is the aim and significance of the paper 'Robust Preference-Guided Denoising for Graph based Social Recommendation'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_32>>title>>Robust Preference-Guided Denoising for Graph based Social Recommendation": 0.15291489362716676, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_32>>title>>Robust Preference-Guided Denoising for Graph based Social Recommendation": 0.16783924102783201, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_103>>title>>Robust Preference-Guided Denoising for Graph based Social Recommendation": 0.17018009424209593, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems>>SESSION: Workshop: Workshop on Decision Making for Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems_5>>abstract>>Social networks are platforms where content creators and consumers share and consume content.

However, most existing recommendation methods collect these ego graphs from all users to compose a global graph to obtain high-order collaborative information between users and items, and these centralized CF recommendation methods inevitably lead to a high risk of user privacy leakage. Although recently proposed federated recommendation systems can mitigate the privacy problem, they either restrict the on-device local training to an isolated ego graph or rely on an additional third-party server to access other ego graphs resulting in a cumbersome pipeline, which is hard to work in practice.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising paradigm for this goal, as it directly optimizes overall performance of sequential recommendation. However, many existing RL-based approaches induce huge computational overhead, because they require not only the recommended items but also all other candidate items to be stored. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work. With online A/B experiments on real-world RS, we confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach and the importance of modeling the two types of randomness.": 0.19496692419052125, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_131>>title>>Confident Action Decision via Hierarchical Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation": 0.1956515073776245, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_60>>title>>Confident Action Decision via Hierarchical Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation": 0.19864274263381956}, "What are the observed limitations of embedding-based methods in recommender systems as stated in the paper 'Adap-τ : Adaptively Modulating Embedding Magnitude for Recommendation'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_31>>title>>Adap-$\tau$: Adaptively Modulating Embedding Magnitude for Recommendation": 0.1958871603012085, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_27>>abstract>>Deep neural networks have achieved great success in sequential recommendation systems. While maintaining high competence in user modeling and next-item recommendation, these models have long been plagued by the numerous parameters and computation, which inhibit them to be deployed on resource-constrained mobile devices. Model quantization, as one of the main paradigms for compression techniques, converts float parameters to low-bit values to reduce parameter redundancy and accelerate inference. To avoid drastic performance degradation, it usually requests a fine-tuning phase with an original dataset. However, the training set of user-item interactions is not always available due to transmission limits or privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to quantize sequential recommenders without access to any real private data. A generator is employed in the framework to synthesize fake sequence samples to feed the quantized sequential recommendation model and minimize the gap with a full-precision sequential recommendation model. The generator and the quantized model are optimized with a min-max game — alternating discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer. Moreover, we devise a two-level discrepancy modeling strategy to transfer information between the quantized model and the full-precision model. The extensive experiments of various recommendation networks on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.": 0.20016442537307738}, "Where will the WebSci24 happen?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>News>>News_2>>url>>https://websci23.webscience.org/websci24-coming-to-germany/": 0.1424069881439209, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>description>>description_1>>WebSci’23 – 15th ACM Web Science Conference": 0.14461169242858887, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>description>>description_4>>https://websci23.webscience.org/": 0.14636141061782837, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>Venue>>Both the WebConf2023 and WebSci’23 will take place at: AT&T Hotel and Conference Center at The University of Texas at Austin 1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705": 0.14689260721206665, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Mon May 01>>Mon May 01_20>>event>>Satelite Event: WebSci": 0.146969473361969, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>News>>News_1>>url>>https://websci23.webscience.org/web-science-test-of-time-award-2023/": 0.14710628986358643, "WWW2023>>Program>>Program Overview>>Sunday April 30>>Sunday April 30_4>>event>>WebSci": 0.14755738973617555, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>Travel Information>>Travel Information_1>>WebSci and SIGWEB are pleased to announce the availability of a fund to help support attendance to WebSci 2023 in Austin, TX, USA.": 0.1498306155204773, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Partners>>url4>>https://webscience.org/": 0.1501649498939514, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Conference>>The Web Conference": 0.1524650812149048, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>sections>>sections_2>>content>>content_12>>6:00 pm – 6:45 pm: The Future of Web Science Panel\nModerated by Ágnes Horvát, Northwestern University:\nPanelists:\n- Deborah McGuinness, RPI\n- Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Northeastern University\n- Weihang Wang, USC\n- Noshir Contractor, Northwestern University\n- Dame Wendy Hall, University of Southampton": 0.15354818105697632}, "Which event has a best paper award announced?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_2>>The annual best paper award": 0.15468463897705076, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_1>>Yelena Mejova, ISI Foundation, Turin (Chair)": 0.17506293058395386, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>ProvenanceWeek2023>>Organizers>>Tracks>>“Best of the Rest”>>As ProvenanceWeek is meant to bring together the provenance community, which is now established and publishing in conferences and journals across computational domains, the Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP) is forming a “Best of the Rest” category.

The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to generate multi-objective policies for four different psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal cases. We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses.

Such dynamics are important in shaping processes and outcomes in society, from trending items in entertainment, collective knowledge creation, to election outcomes. The outcomes of online cultural markets are susceptible to intricate social influence dynamics, particularly so when the community comprises consumers with heterogeneous interests. This has made formal analysis of these markets improbable. In this paper, we remedy this by establishing robust connections between influence dynamics and optimization processes, in trial-offer markets where the consumer preferences are modelled by multinomial logit. Among other results, we show that the proportional-response-esque influence dynamic is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent on a convex objective function, thus leading to a stable and predictable outcome. When all consumers are homogeneous, the objective function has a natural interpretation as a weighted sum of efficiency and diversity of the culture market. In simulations driven by real-world preferences collected from a large-scale recommender system, we observe that ranking strategies aligned with the underlying heterogeneous preferences are more stable, and achieves higher efficiency and diversity. More broadly, we see this work as the first step in connecting computational methods for classical markets to the problem area of online attention and recommender systems.

However, the use of such algorithms comes with trade-offs in terms of algorithmic fairness, which has been widely acknowledged. Specifically, we have empirically observed that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn, causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive users. To address the above issues, we propose DP-Fair, a two-stage framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations. The experimental results, based on Amazon datasets, and user history logs collected from Etsy, one of the largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of both overall accuracy and user group fairness on both shallow and deep recommendation models compared to vanilla DP-SGD.": 0.15614174604415892, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_16>>abstract>>Algorithmic fairness has become an important machine learning problem, especially for mission-critical Web applications. This work presents a self-supervised model, called DualFair, that can debias sensitive attributes like gender and race from learned representations. Unlike existing models that target a single type of fairness, our model jointly optimizes for two fairness criteria—group fairness and counterfactual fairness—and hence makes fairer predictions at both the group and individual levels. Our model uses contrastive loss to generate embeddings that are indistinguishable for each protected group, while forcing the embeddings of counterfactual pairs to be similar. It then uses a self-knowledge distillation method to maintain the quality of representation for the downstream tasks. Extensive analysis over multiple datasets confirms the model’s validity and further shows the synergy of jointly addressing two fairness criteria, suggesting the model’s potential value in fair intelligent Web applications.": 0.16150875091552735}, "What is the topic discussed in the work 'Toward Open-domain Slot Filling via Self-supervised Co-training' by Adib Mosharrof, Moghis Fereidouni, and A.B.

By learning dense representations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed by MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles.

Most existing works rank the features and then select the top-k ones as the final feature subset. However, they assess feature importance individually and ignore the interrelationship between features. Consequently, multiple features with high relevance may be selected simultaneously, resulting in sub-optimal result. In this work, we solve this problem by proposing an AutoML-based feature selection framework that can automatically search the optimal feature subset. Specifically, we first embed the search space into a weight-sharing Supernet. Then, a two-stage neural architecture search method is employed to evaluate the feature quality. In the first stage, a well-designed sampling method considering feature convergence fairness is applied to train the Supernet. In the second stage, a reinforcement learning method is used to search for the optimal feature subset efficiently.

Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image).

Many failure prediction approaches have been proposed to predict cloud failures before they actually occur, so that proactive actions can be taken to ensure service reliability. In industrial practice, existing failure prediction approaches mainly focus on utilizing state-of-the-art time series models to enhance the performance of failure prediction but neglect the training strategy. However, as curriculum learning points out, models perform better when they are trained with data in an order of easy-to-difficult. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a novel training strategy for cloud failure prediction, which greatly improves the performance of the existing cloud failure prediction models. Our experimental results on industrial and public datasets show that EDITS can obviously enhance the performance of cloud failure prediction model. In addition, EDITS also outperforms other curriculum learning methods. More encouragingly, our proposed EDITS has been successfully applied to Microsoft 365 and Azure online service systems, and has obviously reduced financial losses caused by cloud failures.": 0.21138112545013427, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_4>>title>>FedEdge: Accelerating Edge-Assisted Federated Learning": 0.2122785210609436}, "What is the name of the proposed system in the paper 'Learning Cooperative Oversubscription for Cloud by Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_7>>title>>Learning Cooperative Oversubscription for Cloud by Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning": 0.15932806730270385, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_7>>title>>Learning Cooperative Oversubscription for Cloud by Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning": 0.1664270877838135, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_8>>abstract>>Oversubscription is a common practice for improving cloud resource utilization. It allows the cloud service provider to sell more resources than the physical limit, assuming not all users would fully utilize the resources simultaneously. However, how to design an oversubscription policy that improves utilization while satisfying some safety constraints remains an open problem. Existing methods and industrial practices are over-conservative, ignoring the coordination of diverse resource usage patterns and probabilistic constraints. To address these two limitations, this paper formulates the oversubscription for cloud as a chance-constrained optimization problem and proposes an effective Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (C2MARL) method to solve this problem. Specifically, C2MARL reduces the number of constraints by considering their upper bounds and leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm to learn a safe and optimal coordination policy. We evaluate our C2MARL on an internal cloud platform and public cloud datasets. Experiments show that our C2MARL outperforms existing methods in improving utilization () under different levels of safety constraints.": 0.16921565532684324, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted

Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.": 0.16751571893692016, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_21>>title>>TEA: Time-aware Entity Alignment in Knowledge Graphs": 0.16807281970977783}, "What was the focus of the 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_1>>title>>The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things": 0.07707898616790772, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_1>>abstract>>Deep learning and the Web of Things (WoT) have become powerful tools for web engineering, leading to increased investigation and publication of research related to deep learning in web engineering.

Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM) is the task of finding useful patterns that statistically occur more often from databases for one class than for another. The existing SSPM task does not consider the weight of each item. While in the real world, the significant level of different items/objects is various. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Weighted Statistically Significant Patterns Mining (WSSPM) problem and propose a novel WSSpm algorithm to successfully solve it. We present a new framework that effectively mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. We also propose a new weighted support threshold that can satisfy the demand of WSSPM and prove its correctness and completeness. Besides, our weighted support threshold and modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range. Finally, experimental results on several real datasets show that the WSSpm algorithm performs well in terms of execution time and memory storage.": 0.18349897861480713, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Topics include (but are not limited to)>>Machine learning and data science for the Web>>Machine learning and data science for the Web_5>>Robustness and generalizability of Web mining methods": 0.18811172246932983, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Topics include (but are not limited to)>>Machine learning and data science for the Web>>Machine learning and data science for the Web_2>>Machine learning algorithms for large-scale content mining": 0.1887321352958679}, "What is the purpose of DSNet in video salient object detection for IoT and WoT applications?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_5>>abstract>>The most challenging aspects of deploying deep models in IoT and embedded systems are extensive computational complexity and large training and inference time. Although various lightweight versions of state-of-the-art models are also being designed, maintaining the performance of such models is difficult. To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect). The extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art approaches in terms of computational complexity, number of parameters, and latency measures.": 0.1377239227294922, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_5>>title>>DSNet: Efficient Lightweight Model for Video Salient Object Detection for IoT and WoT Applications": 0.1697957396507263}, "What is the importance of a human-centric approach in the concept of a Metaverse?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things>>SESSION: Workshop: The 3rd International Workshop on Deep Learning for the Web of Things_6>>abstract>>In the era of the Web of Things, the Metaverse is expected to be the landing site for the next generation of the Internet, resulting in the increased popularity of related technologies and applications in recent years and gradually becoming the focus of Internet research. The Metaverse, as a link between the real and virtual worlds, can provide users with immersive experiences. As the concept of the Metaverse grows in popularity, many scholars and developers begin to focus on the Metaverse’s ethics and core. This paper argues that the Metaverse should be centered on humans. That is, humans constitute the majority of the Metaverse. As a result, we begin this paper by introducing the Metaverse’s origins, characteristics, related technologies, and the concept of the human-centric Metaverse (HCM). Second, we discuss the manifestation of human-centric in the Metaverse. Finally, we discuss some current issues in the construction of HCM. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the applications of human-centric technologies in the Metaverse, as well as the relevant HCM application scenarios. We hope that this paper can provide researchers and developers with some directions and ideas for human-centric Metaverse construction.": 0.12537482976913453}, "What are the aspects of Web 3.0 and its

throughput and precision in the applied domain. A vast amount of work is being carried out in QA systems to deliver better content satisfying users’ information needs [2]. Since QA systems are ascending the cycle of emerging technologies, there are potential research gaps that can be explored. QA systems form a significant part of Conversational Artificial Intelligent systems giving rise to a new research pathway, i.e., Conversational Question Answering (CQA) systems [32]. We propose to design and develop a CQA system leveraging Hypergraph-based techniques. The approach focuses on the multi-turn conversation and multi-context to gauge users’ exact information needs and deliver better answers. We further aim to address \"supporting evidence-based retrieval\" for fact-based responsible answer generation. Since the QA system requires a large amount of data and processing, we also intend to investigate hardware performance for effective system utilization.": 0.17383813858032227, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction>>SESSION: Workshop: NLP4KGC: Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Graph Construction_3>>title>>Query-Driven Knowledge Graph Construction using Question Answering and Multimodal Fusion": 0.17426806688308716, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_17>>authors>>authors_5>>Qinghua Zheng": 0.17467676401138305, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Semantics and Knowledge>>Semantics and Knowledge_12>>authors>>authors_6>>Jiawei Sheng and Jianxin Li": 0.17506264448165892}, "What is the title of the paper by Fuyuan Lyu, Xing Tang, Dugang Liu, Liang Chen, Xiuqiang He and Xue Liu?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_208>>authors>>authors_5>>Xingliang Yuan and Chunyang Chen": 0.15207762718200685, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_78>>authors>>authors_9>>Xiangyu Zhao and Yongfeng Zhang": 0.15251139402389524, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_10>>authors>>authors_4>>Xianghua Li and Xuelong Li": 0.1580654740333557, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_145>>authors>>authors_5>>Huamin Feng and Yongdong Zhang": 0.15898020267486573, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_37>>authors>>authors_5>>Xing Xie and Enhong Chen": 0.1591281294822693, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_350>>authors>>authors_7>>Yunjun Gao and Xing Xie": 0.15948430299758912, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_60>>authors>>authors_4>>Xueyan Liu and Bo Yang": 0.160517418384552, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_66>>authors>>authors_3>>Wentao Wang and Jiliang Tang": 0.160724413394928, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_35>>authors>>authors_5>>Meixi Liu and Jianfeng Li": 0.16073482036590575, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_18>>authors>>authors_4>>Zirui Chen and Jianxin Li": 0.16143091917037963, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_191>>authors>>authors_6>>Yuesheng Zhu and Yadong Mu": 0.1616549849510193, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_12>>authors>>authors_5>>Hui Xue and Wenwu Zhu": 0.16177988052368164, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_56>>authors>>authors_3>>Chenghao Liu and Jianling Sun": 0.16228797435760497}, "Who are the organizers of the 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)_1>>title>>13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb) Overview": 0.08766448497772217, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)>>SESSION: Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)_1>>abstract>>The TempWeb workshop series has a long-standing tradition as a co-located event at The Web Conference. Its main objectives are to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. For this, research published at TempWeb covers (and has covered in its previous editions) the full spectrum of longitudinal studies using web content. This ranges from “low-level” network analysis (e.g., Internet traffic) and graph analysis (e.g., in social media) up to “high-level” content and concept analysis ranging from micro-content (e.g., tweets) up to entire web archives. As such, TempWeb has become a potential object of longitudinal studies on its own. Aiming at the investigation of infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Web scale, TempWeb has developed as a forum for a community from science and industry. Since longitudinal aspects in web content analysis is becoming more and more relevant for analysts from various domains, the studies, tools, and demonstrations are not only relevant for computer science, but also potentially interesting for sociology, marketing, environmental studies, politics, etc. Keeping up with its “tradition”, the current edition covers again the full spectrum of temporal Web analytics at various levels of granularity.": 0.1245155096054077, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_10>>workshopName>>13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)": 0.12671003341674805, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Mon May 01>>Mon May 01_14>>event>>Workshop: 13th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)": 0.14385329484939574}, "What is the website for the 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_1>>title>>1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies": 0.08669366836547851, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_3>>abstract>>Given the considerable potential in overcoming the challenges of protecting users’ privacy while making the most of available data, we propose a workshop on Federated Learning Technologies (FLT) at TheWebConf 2023.": 0.1202884793281555, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_2>>title>>Federated Learning for Metaverse: A Survey": 0.12811496257781982, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_4>>title>>A Survey of Trustworthy Federated Learning with Perspectives on Security, Robustness and Privacy": 0.13498222827911377, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Workshops>>Accepted Workshops_20>>workshopName>>1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies": 0.1371896505355835, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_2>>abstract>>Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed to develop better AI systems without compromising users’ privacy and the legitimate interests of private companies.

We anticipate our work to be a starting point for further research on exploratory computational framing analysis using pretrained Transformers.": 0.19533011913299558}, "Where will both the WebConf2023 and WebSci'23 take place?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>Venue>>Both the WebConf2023 and WebSci’23 will take place at: AT&T Hotel and Conference Center at The University of Texas at Austin 1900 University Ave, Austin, TX 78705": 0.11984192132949828, "WWW2023>>calls>>Web Developer and W3C>>conferenceName>>The Web Conference 2023": 0.1269128680229187, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.13461531400680543, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>Conference>>website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.13666945695877075, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Conference>>The Web Conference": 0.1383230209350586, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Registration>>Travel Information>>Travel Information_1>>WebSci and SIGWEB are pleased to announce the availability of a fund to help support attendance to WebSci 2023 in Austin, TX, USA.": 0.1391352415084839, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops_1>>title>>Workshops at the Web Conference 2023": 0.14006913900375367, "WWW2023>>calls>>PhD Symposium>>description>>We invite contributions to the PhD Symposium to be held at The Web Conference 2023 (formerly known as WWW).

WASPur, a tool to automatically identify the purposes of WebAssembly functions. To build this tool, we first construct an extensive collection of WebAssembly samples that represent the state of WebAssembly. Second, we analyze the dataset and identify the diverse use cases of the collected WebAssembly modules. We leverage the dataset of WebAssembly modules to construct semantics-aware intermediate representations (IR) of the functions in the modules. We encode the function IR for use in a machine learning classifier, and we find that this classifier can predict the similarity of a given function against known named functions with an accuracy rate of 88.07%.

One such problem faced by e-commerce platforms is Return To Origin (RTO), where the user cancels an order while it is in transit for delivery. In such a scenario platform faces logistics and opportunity costs. Traditionally, models trained on historical trends are used to predict the propensity of an order becoming RTO. Sociology literature has highlighted clear correlations between socio-economic indicators and users’ tendency to exploit systems to gain financial advantage. Social media profiles have information about location, education, and profession which have been shown to be an estimator of socio-economic condition. We believe combining social media data with e-commerce information can lead to improvements in a variety of tasks like RTO, recommendation, fraud detection, and credit modeling. In our proposed system, we find the public social profile of an e-commerce user and extract socio-economic features. Internal data fused with extracted social features are used to train a RTO order detection model. Our system demonstrates a performance improvement in RTO detection of 3.1% and 19.9% on precision and recall, respectively.

However, existing detection methods in the audio area exclusively work in English, and there is a lack of data resources in other languages. Cross-lingual deepfake detection, a critical but rarely explored area, urges more study. This paper conducts the first comprehensive study on the cross-lingual perspective of deepfake detection. We observe that English data enriched in deepfake algorithms can teach a detector the knowledge of various spoofing artifacts, contributing to performing detection across language domains. Based on the observation, we first construct a first-of-its-kind cross-lingual evaluation dataset including heterogeneous spoofed speech uttered in the two most widely spoken languages, then explored domain adaptation (DA) techniques to transfer the artifacts detection capability and propose effective and practical DA strategies fitting the cross-lingual scenario. Our adversarial-based DA paradigm teaches the model to learn real/fake knowledge while losing language dependency. Extensive experiments over 137-hour audio clips validate the adapted models can detect fake audio generated by unseen algorithms in the new domain.": 0.1556623697280884, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_7>>title>>Transferring Audio Deepfake Detection Capability across Languages": 0.16792298555374144, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_193>>title>>Transferring Audio Deepfake Detection Capability across Languages": 0.17557475566864011, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_7>>title>>Transferring Audio Deepfake Detection Capability across Languages": 0.17624201774597167}, "What could be the focus of the research paper titled 'Efficient and Low Overhead Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses based on TCP/IP Traffic'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Security, Privacy, and Trust>>Security, Privacy, and Trust_3>>title>>Efficient and Low Overhead Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses based on TCP/IP Traffic": 0.1413934350013733, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_3>>title>>Efficient and Low Overhead Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses based on TCP/IP Traffic": 0.14770123958587647, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_189>>title>>Efficient and Low Overhead Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses based on TCP/IP Traffic": 0.1503843069076538, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust>>SESSION: Security, Privacy & Trust_4>>abstract>>Website fingerprinting attack is an extensively studied technique used in a web browser to analyze traffic patterns and thus infer confidential information about users. Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency.": 0.17359334230422974, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Wed May 03>>Wed

canonical quasi-linear framework. The crux of the argument lies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first the auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA or mCPA bidding format (and submit bids accordingly); and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can revisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending on the bids submitted by the bidders). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format compared to the classic mCPA format.": 0.17086130380630493, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_2>>authors>>authors_4>>Hanrui Zhang and Song Zuo": 0.1737715244293213}, "Are there any papers presented by Ioannis Caragiannis in the Research Track: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_20>>authors>>authors_1>>Ioannis Caragiannis": 0.14553873538970946, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_20>>authors>>authors_1>>Ioannis Caragiannis": 0.15734338760375977, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Track name>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track": 0.1589435338973999, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_11>>authors>>authors_1>>Marios Papachristou": 0.15968225002288816, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>SESSION: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_20>>authors>>authors_2>>George Christodoulou": 0.15980130434036255, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_20>>authors>>authors_2>>George Christodoulou and Nicos Protopapas": 0.1617811441421509, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Topics>>Topics_8>>Economics of Crowdsourcing and Labor Markets (please also read the CFP of the “Crowdsourcing and Human Computation” track)": 0.16600809097290037, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_18>>title>>Platform Behavior under Market Shocks: A Simulation Framework and Reinforcement-Learning Based Study": 0.16700003147125245}, "How many papers were presented in Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets research track under the Program?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Track name>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track": 0.1264999747276306, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_18>>title>>Platform Behavior under Market Shocks: A Simulation Framework and Reinforcement-Learning Based Study": 0.1448227405548096, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Topics>>Topics_2>>Fairness and Privacy in Economic Environments (please also read the CFP of the “Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics on the Web” track)": 0.14659848213195803, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Topics>>Topics_8>>Economics of Crowdsourcing and Labor Markets (please also read the CFP of the “Crowdsourcing and Human Computation” track)": 0.1482769250869751, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>AdditionalInformation>>Authors should consult the conference’s main Research Track CFP(https://www2023.thewebconf.org/calls/research-tracks/) to ensure their submissions are aligned with broader conference expectations, scope, and theme: “Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility”.

Analysis_50>>abstract>>There has been growing interest in the so-called “Web3” movement. This loosely refers to a mix of decentralized technologies, often underpinned by blockchain technologies. Among these, Web3 social media platforms have begun to emerge. These store all social interaction data (e.g., posts) on a public ledger, removing the need for centralized data ownership and management. But this comes at a cost, which some argue is prohibitively expensive. As an exemplar within this growing ecosytem, we explore memo.cash, a microblogging service built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. We gather data for 24K users, 317K posts, 2.57M user actions, which have facilitated $6.75M worth of transactions. A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.": 0.1850305676460266, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Tue May 02>>Tue May 02_9>>subsessions>>subsessions_7>>subsession>>9575-Know Your Transactions: Real-time and Generic Transaction Semantic Representation on Blockchain & Web3 Ecosystem": 0.1889417290687561, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_45>>title>>Set in Stone: Analysis of an Immutable Web3 Social Media Platform": 0.18949582576751708}, "What is the name of the paper authored by Zhiying Wu, Jieli Liu, Jiajing Wu, Zibin Zheng, Xiapu Luo, and Ting Chen?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_208>>authors>>authors_5>>Xingliang Yuan and Chunyang Chen": 0.15234065055847168, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_78>>authors>>authors_9>>Xiangyu Zhao and Yongfeng Zhang": 0.15304607152938843, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_42>>authors>>authors_6>>Qingwen Liu and Xiaoyi Zeng": 0.15563597679138183, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_191>>authors>>authors_6>>Yuesheng Zhu and Yadong Mu": 0.15686153173446654, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_275>>authors>>authors_3>>Xin Peng and Ziming Wang": 0.1573351979255676, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_66>>authors>>authors_3>>Wentao Wang and Jiliang Tang": 0.15753179788589478, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things>>SESSION: Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things_23>>authors>>authors_2>>Zhijun Ding": 0.1578792691230774, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_21>>authors>>authors_6>>Hongyang Chen and Peng Zhang": 0.15797348022460939, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_145>>authors>>authors_5>>Huamin Feng and Yongdong Zhang": 0.15825648307800294, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_182>>authors>>authors_5>>Xiapu Luo and Ting Chen": 0.15985338687896727, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_76>>authors>>authors_2>>Jiawei Chen": 0.16000479459762573, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_189>>authors>>authors_6>>Liming Fang and Zhe Liu": 0.16011184453964233, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_38>>authors>>authors_11>>Beilun Wang and Junzhou Luo": 0.1604100227355957, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_193>>authors>>authors_6>>Li Lu and Zhenguang Liu": 0.16082820892333985}, "What is the title of the paper written by authors Sunjae Kim and Wonjun Lee for the 'Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT' research track?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_18>>authors>>authors_5>>Bingshuai Li and Guihai Chen": 0.13441798686981202, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile, and WoT_1>>title>>Beyond Fine-Tuning: Efficient and Effective Fed-Tuning for Mobile/Web Users": 0.13729884624481203, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things Track>>TrackName>>Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things (WoT)": 0.13979004621505736, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things Track>>TrackDescription>>The Systems and Infrastructure for Web, Mobile Web, and Web of Things (WoT) track solicits novel research contributions describing the performance, architecture, and construction of systems related to the Web and Web-based mobile and ubiquitous computing.

The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library. Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference.

Transparency and Ethics on the Web_5>>abstract>>This paper presents a method for assessing whether algorithmic decision making induces disparate impact in online retailing. The proposed method specifies a statistical design, a sampling algorithm, and a technological setup for data collection through web crawling. The statistical design reduces the dimensionality of the problem and ensures that the data collected are representative, variation-rich, and suitable for the investigation of the causes behind any observed disparities. Implementations of the method can collect data on algorithmic decisions, such as price, recommendations, and delivery fees that can be matched to website visitor demographic data from established sources such as censuses and large scale surveys. The combined data can be used to investigate the presence and causes of disparate impact, potentially helping online retailers audit their algorithms without collecting or holding the demographic data of their users. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of the automated pricing decisions of a leading retailer in the United States. A custom-built platform implemented the method to collect data for nearly 20,000 different grocery products at more than 3,000 randomly-selected zip codes. The data collected indicates that prices are higher for locations with high proportions of minority households. Although these price disparities can be partly attributed to algorithmic biases, they are mainly explained by local factors and therefore can be regarded as business necessities.":

Collaborative Filtering (ECF) model that leverages interpretable cluster learning to achieve the two most demanding objectives: (1) Precise - the model should not compromise accuracy in the pursuit of explainability; and (2) Self-explainable - the model’s explanations should truly reflect its decision-making process, not generated from post-hoc methods. The core of ECF is mining taste clusters from user-item interactions and item profiles. We map each user and item to a sparse set of taste clusters, and taste clusters are distinguished by a few representative tags. The user-item preference, users/items’ cluster affiliations, and the generation of taste clusters are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we introduce a forest mechanism to ensure the model’s accuracy, explainability, and diversity. To comprehensively evaluate the explainability quality of taste clusters, we design several quantitative metrics, including in-cluster item coverage, tag utilization, silhouette, and informativeness. Our model’s effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets.": 0.18090285062789918, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_1>>authors>>authors_3>>Jianling Wang and James Caverlee": 0.18196890354156495, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_7>>authors>>authors_5>>Jintao Li and Tat-Seng Chua": 0.18251572847366332, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>User Modeling and Personalization>>User Modeling and Personalization_12>>authors>>authors_4>>Jian Zhang and Jianping Fan": 0.18334996700286865}, "Who is delivering the Turing Award Lecture at the ACM Web Conference and which event is held in his honor?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>ACM A.M.

However, as centralized data providers, their reliability remains under-studied. As a case study, we investigate Beaconcha.in , a leading explorer serving Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) update. According to the explorer, we find that more than 75% of slashable Byzantine actions were not slashed. Since Ethereum relies on the “stake-and-slash\" mechanism to align incentives, this finding would at its face value cause concern over Ethereum’s security. However, further investigation reveals that all the apparent unslashed incidents were erroneously recorded due to the explorer’s mishandling of consensus edge cases.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving.

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively.

Yet, existing methodologies fail to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics.": 0.17661314010620116}, "What is the title of the paper presented at the ACM Web Conference 2023?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Call for Nominations for the Seoul Test of Time Award of The ACM Web Conference 2023>>conferenceName>>The ACM Web Conference 2023": 0.10144033432006835, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_17>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583543": 0.11491098403930664, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_1>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583210": 0.11556836366653442, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Workshops_1>>title>>Workshops at the Web Conference 2023": 0.11564421653747559, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_5>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587302": 0.1179115891456604, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_51>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3587349": 0.11900515556335449, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_33>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543873.3584653": 0.11925326585769652, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web & Society>>SESSION: Web & Society_8>>url>>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3543507.3583400": 0.11940625905990601}, "Who are the authors of the research paper 'Tutorials at The Web Conference 2023'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>abstract>>This paper summarizes the content of the 28 tutorials that have been given at The Web Conference 2023.": 0.1217181921005249, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Tutorials_1>>title>>Tutorials at The Web Conference 2023": 0.1220172166824341, "WWW2023>>About>>Organizing Committee>>TUTORIAL CHAIRS>>contact>>tutorial2023@thewebconf.org": 0.1393779397010803, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Tutorials Proposals>>description>>We invite proposals for tutorials to be held at The Web Conference 2023 (formerly known as WWW).

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing. Finally, crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.": 0.1744831085205078}, "What is the event scheduled at 9:00 AM – 10:30 AM in AT&T Hotel and Conference Center- Classroom #101?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_28>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #101": 0.14380433559417724, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_17>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #103": 0.14553476572036744, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_32>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Classroom #108": 0.145780348777771, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_5>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center -

In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.": 0.13979580402374267, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Conference>>website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.14180922508239746, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>Website>>https://www2023.thewebconf.org/": 0.14210891723632812}, "What are the events at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center - Classroom #108 on Sun Apr 30?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_28>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #101": 0.12976677417755128, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_17>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #103": 0.13224940299987792, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_32>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center Classroom #108": 0.13329768180847168, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_5>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center -  Classroom #107": 0.13641873598098755, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_6>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center - Classroom #108": 0.13777556419372558, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_7>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center - Classroom #104": 0.13906900882720946, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_10>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center - Classroom #115": 0.13970185518264772, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_23>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center -  Classroom #101": 0.1402341604232788, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_27>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #108": 0.1405951976776123, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_20>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center-  Classroom #203": 0.1408151149749756, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_11>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center- Classroom #202": 0.14087083339691162, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_4>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center -  Classroom #101": 0.14112111330032348, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_26>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center -  Classroom #104": 0.14284095764160157, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_12>>location>>at AT&T Hotel and Conference Center- Classroom #116": 0.14306484460830687}, "Who is the speaker for the Turing Lecture at the Web Conference?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>ACM A.M.

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively.

To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential.":

Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_7>>abstract>>Social media platforms have enabled extremists to organize violent events, such as the 2021 U.S. Capitol Attack. Simultaneously, these platforms enable professional investigators and amateur sleuths to collaboratively collect and identify imagery of suspects with the goal of holding them accountable for their actions. Through a case study of Sedition Hunters, a Twitter community whose goal is to identify individuals who participated in the 2021 U.S. Capitol Attack, we explore what are the main topics or targets of the community, who participates in the community, and how. Using topic modeling, we find that information sharing is the main focus of the community. We also note an increase in awareness of privacy concerns. Furthermore, using social network analysis, we show how some participants played important roles in the community. Finally, we discuss implications for the content and structure of online crowdsourced investigations.": 0.18450115919113158, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Tue May 02>>Tue May 02_13>>subsessions>>subsessions_2>>subsession>>8863-Sedition Hunters: A Quantitative Study of the Crowdsourced Investigation into the 2021 U.S. Capitol Attack": 0.1863350749015808, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web and Society>>Web and Society_16>>authors>>authors_3>>Douglas N.

of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_36>>abstract>>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have seen widespread usage across multiple real-world applications, yet in transductive learning, they still face challenges in accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, due to the extensive number of trainable parameters in the embedding table and the paradigm of stacking neighborhood aggregations. This paper presents a novel model called xGCN for large-scale network embedding, which is a practical solution for link predictions. xGCN addresses these issues by encoding graph-structure data in an extreme convolutional manner, and has the potential to push the performance of network embedding-based link predictions to a new record. Specifically, instead of assigning each node with a directly learnable embedding vector, xGCN regards node embeddings as static features. It uses a propagation operation to smooth node embeddings and relies on a Refinement neural Network (RefNet) to transform the coarse embeddings derived from the unsupervised propagation into new ones that optimize a training objective. The output of RefNet, which are well-refined embeddings, will replace the original node embeddings. This process is repeated iteratively until the model converges to a satisfying status. Experiments on three social network datasets with link prediction tasks show that xGCN not only achieves the best accuracy compared with a series of competitive baselines but also is highly efficient and scalable.": 0.16538947820663452, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms Track>>Topics include (but are not limited to) the following research areas>>AlgorithmsAndModeling>>AlgorithmsAndModeling_10>>Network Representation Learning and Graph Embeddings": 0.16604913473129274, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_12>>title>>Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Learning Enabled Socioeconomic Indicator Prediction in Location-Based Social Network": 0.16680763959884642}, "In the 'Search 3 and Web Mining: Search and Retrieval' session, what is the topic of the subsession starting at 1:50 PM?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Track name>>Web Mining and Content Analysis Track": 0.14999264478683472, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_20>>title>>Incorporating Explicit Subtopics in Personalized Search": 0.15466477870941164, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_9>>title>>CL-WSTC: Continual Learning for Weakly Supervised Text Classification on the Internet": 0.154944908618927, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web Mining and Content Analysis Track>>Topics include (but are not limited to)>>Machine learning and data science for the Web>>Machine learning and data science for the Web_5>>Robustness and generalizability of Web mining methods": 0.15559529066085814}, "What is the last subsession topic under the 'Security 4: Blockchains and distributed ledgers' session?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Security, Privacy & Trust Track>>Topics>>Topics_5>>Blockchains and distributed ledgers": 0.18808581829071044, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_8>>event>>Security 4: Blockchains and distributed ledgers": 0.19799449443817138, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd International Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 2nd International Cryptoasset Analytics Workshop (CAAW)_1>>abstract>>This half-day workshop on Cryptoasset Analytics allows researchers from different disciplines to present their newest findings related to cryptoassets.

The crux of the argument lies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first the auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA or mCPA bidding format (and submit bids accordingly); and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can revisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending on the bids submitted by the bidders). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format compared to the classic mCPA format.": 0.16756346225738525, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Wed May 03>>Wed May 03_13>>subsessions>>subsessions_1>>subsession>>1057-Ad Auction Design with Coupon-Dependent Conversion Rate in the Auto-bidding World": 0.17189015150070192, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Wed May 03>>Wed May 03_13>>subsessions>>subsessions_2>>subsession>>SPOTLIGHT: 1136-Autobidding Auctions in the Presence of User Costs": 0.17334500551223755, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets Track>>Topics>>Topics_1>>Advertising Auctions, Markets, and Exchanges": 0.1745189666748047}, "What are the details of the 'BBQ and Concert at Stubbs BBQ' event on 'Wed May 03'?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Wed May 03>>Wed May 03_33>>event>>BBQ and Concert at Stubbs BBQ": 0.1366979479789734, "WWW2023>>Program>>BBQ and Live Music>>Description>>Enjoy a typical Austin night out at the iconic Stubbs with BBQ and live music with local Austin bands.

This paper presents a novel model called xGCN for large-scale network embedding, which is a practical solution for link predictions. xGCN addresses these issues by encoding graph-structure data in an extreme convolutional manner, and has the potential to push the performance of network embedding-based link predictions to a new record. Specifically, instead of assigning each node with a directly learnable embedding vector, xGCN regards node embeddings as static features. It uses a propagation operation to smooth node embeddings and relies on a Refinement neural Network (RefNet) to transform the coarse embeddings derived from the unsupervised propagation into new ones that optimize a training objective. The output of RefNet, which are well-refined embeddings, will replace the original node embeddings. This process is repeated iteratively until the model converges to a satisfying status. Experiments on three social network datasets with link prediction tasks show that xGCN not only achieves the best accuracy compared with a series of competitive baselines but also is highly efficient and scalable.": 0.17084994316101076, "WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms Track>>Topics include (but are not limited to) the following research areas>>AlgorithmsAndModeling>>AlgorithmsAndModeling_10>>Network Representation Learning and Graph Embeddings": 0.17178012132644654, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)_2>>title>>Graph Embedding for Mapping Interdisciplinary Research Networks": 0.17622541189193724, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_26>>title>>Predicting the Silent Majority on Graphs: Knowledge Transferable Graph Neural Network": 0.17708765268325805}, "What development has been mentioned in the paper 'Application of an ontology for model cards to generate computable artifacts for linking machine learning information from biomedical research'?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)_8>>title>>Application of an ontology for model cards to generate computable artifacts for linking machine learning information from biomedical research": 0.13621453046798704, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)_11>>abstract>>Model card reports provide a transparent description of machine learning models which includes information about their evaluation, limitations, intended use, etc. Federal health agencies have expressed an interest in model cards report for research studies using machine-learning based AI.

(ii) The obtained embeddings do not contain much semantic information. Therefore, using these embeddings for semantic tasks is problematic. (iii) They do not enable large-scale training. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the ontology of knowledge graphs and partitions the knowledge graph based on classes to include more semantic information for parallel training of large-scale knowledge graph embeddings.
