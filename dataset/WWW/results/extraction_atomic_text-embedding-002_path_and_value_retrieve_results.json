This abundance of human interaction makes SM particularly attractive for social sensing. Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums, users post information and encourage others to support their side, using symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless, the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals’ stances. We analyze users’ attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines.": 0.1023293137550354, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_6>>title>>Stance Inference in Twitter through Graph Convolutional Collaborative Filtering Networks with Minimal Supervision": 0.10856854915618896}, "What type of music does the band Money Chicha play?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>BBQ and Live Music>>Money Chicha>>description>>Money Chicha is an Austin, Texas based group featuring members of the Grammy-award winning Latin orchestra Grupo Fantasma and its offshoot funk outfit Brownout which performs a fuzzed-out, reverb-drenched and percussion-heavy style of music inspired by the sounds of Peru and Colombia in the 60s and 70s.
