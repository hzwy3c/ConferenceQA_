However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations.

In Brazil, the teaching and learning process in several areas has been stimulated through Academic Competitions generally called Knowledge Olympics, which are essentially student contests that aim to encourage, find talent and awaken interest in the field knowledge presented in the competition. It was precisely for this purpose that the Brazilian Investment Olympics (OBInvest) was born, aiming to democratize access to education and promote reflections on economic and financial issues, through a FL perspective for high school students from all over the country. One of OBInvest’s objectives is to help boosting the development of computational tools, aiming to provide easier access to fundamental data for decision-making in the field of finance. However, from the tools developed by OBInvest, it was noted that the creation of new educational tools would be enhanced through the use of datasets enriched with provenance and aligned with FAIR principles. This work aims to offer a computational strategy based on data science techniques, which is easy to use and also provides curated data series through a reproducible pipeline, using open data on financial reports from publicly listed Brazilian companies, provided by the Brazilian Security and Exchange Commission, called Comissão de Valores Mobiliarios (CMV).

To this end, differentiable vector quantization approaches, such as DiffPQ and DeepPQ, have been recently proposed, but existing methods have two drawbacks. First, they do not impose any constraints on codebooks, such that the resultant codebooks lack diversity, leading to limited retrieval performance. Second, since data indexing resorts to operator, differentiability is usually achieved by either relaxation or Straight-Through Estimation (STE), which leads to biased gradient and slow convergence. To address these problems, we propose a Differentiable Optimized Product Quantization method (DOPQ) and beyond in this paper. Particularly, each data is projected into multiple orthogonal spaces, to generate multiple views of data. Thus, each codebook is learned with one view of data, guaranteeing the diversity of codebooks. Moreover, instead of simple differentiable relaxation, DOPQ optimizes the loss based on direct loss minimization, significantly reducing the gradient bias problem.

Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of Hard Negative Sampling (HNS) have not been revealed yet. In this work, we fill the research gap by conducting thorough theoretical analyses on HNS. Firstly, we prove that employing HNS on the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) learner is equivalent to optimizing One-way Partial AUC (OPAUC). Concretely, the BPR equipped with Dynamic Negative Sampling (DNS) is an exact estimator, while with softmax-based sampling is a soft estimator. Secondly, we prove that OPAUC has a stronger connection with Top-K evaluation metrics than AUC and verify it with simulation experiments. These analyses establish the theoretical foundation of HNS in optimizing Top-K recommendation performance for the first time. On these bases, we offer two insightful guidelines for effective usage of HNS: 1) the sampling hardness should be controllable, e.g., via pre-defined hyper-parameters, to adapt to different Top-K metrics and datasets; 2) the smaller the K we emphasize in Top-K evaluation metrics, the harder the negative samples we should draw.

Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of Hard Negative Sampling (HNS) have not been revealed yet. In this work, we fill the research gap by conducting thorough theoretical analyses on HNS. Firstly, we prove that employing HNS on the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) learner is equivalent to optimizing One-way Partial AUC (OPAUC). Concretely, the BPR equipped with Dynamic Negative Sampling (DNS) is an exact estimator, while with softmax-based sampling is a soft estimator. Secondly, we prove that OPAUC has a stronger connection with Top-K evaluation metrics than AUC and verify it with simulation experiments. These analyses establish the theoretical foundation of HNS in optimizing Top-K recommendation performance for the first time. On these bases, we offer two insightful guidelines for effective usage of HNS: 1) the sampling hardness should be controllable, e.g., via pre-defined hyper-parameters, to adapt to different Top-K metrics and datasets; 2) the smaller the K we emphasize in Top-K evaluation metrics, the harder the negative samples we should draw. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks verify the two guidelines.\n\nQuestion:Will registration fees change over time?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes", "response": "I don't know."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "Can I register for this conference with different time slots?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_1>>date>>Sunday April 30": 0.13751399517059326, "WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_2>>date>>Monday May 1": 0.14528971910476685, "WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_4>>time>>8:30am": 0.1458216905593872, "WWW2023>>Program>>Live Stream of TheWebConf>>page>>schedule>>schedule_2>>time>>5:00pm": 0.147111177444458, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_6>>subsessions>>subsessions_8>>time>>10:20 AM – 10:30 AM": 0.14842575788497925}, "from": "WWW2023/Attendees/Registration", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

Specifically, we train a surrogate model to simulate the target model based on two universal loss functions. For a given behavior sequence, the loss functions ensure the recommended items and corresponding rank of the surrogate model are consistent with the target model’s recommendation. Due to the special training mode of the surrogate model, it is hard to judge which user is its member(non-member). Therefore, we establish a shadow model and use shadow model’s members(non-members) to train the attack model later. Next, we build a user feature generator to construct representative feature vectors from the shadow(surrogate) model. The crafting feature vectors are finally input into the attack model to identify users’ membership. Furthermore, to tackle the high cost of obtaining in-distribution data, we develop two variants of ME-MIA, realizing data-efficient and even data-free MIA by fabricating authentic in-distribution data. Notably, the latter is impossible in the previous works. Finally, we evaluate ME-MIA against multiple sequential recommendation models on three real-world datasets.
