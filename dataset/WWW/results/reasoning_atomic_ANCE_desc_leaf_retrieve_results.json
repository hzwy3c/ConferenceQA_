Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation. This talk discusses concerns around digital labor, data materiality, media literacies, creative value, and online expression. In doing so, it sets a pathway towards designing inclusive and intersectional systems that transcend borders.": 0.004296720027923584, "WWW2023>>Program>>Keynotes>>Keynotes_3>>title>>Decolonizing Creative Labor in the age of AI": 0.004492819309234619, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_4>>speaker>>Payal Arora": 0.004984140396118164, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_4>>event>>Keynote Presentation: Payal Arora Decolonizing Creative Labor in the age of AI": 0.005104422569274902, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Thu May 04>>Thu May 04_4>>speaker_affiliation>>Cofounder Femlab": 0.005935311317443848}, "Which event has a best paper award announced?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_2>>The annual best paper award": 0.011285066604614258, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_4>>These awards are kindly sponsored by the Web Science Trust.": 0.012226521968841553, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_1>>Yelena Mejova, ISI Foundation, Turin (Chair)": 0.012271761894226074, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>desciption>>desciption_1>>This year we will be allocating two awards:": 0.012454986572265625, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>News>>News_3>>url>>https://websci23.webscience.org/best-paper-websci23-awarded/": 0.01291966438293457, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_2>>Yu-Ru Lin, University of Pittsburgh": 0.013473570346832275, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Best Paper Award Committee>>Best Paper Award Committee_3>>Kristina Lerman, University of South California": 0.013753771781921387, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_44>>authors>>authors_6>>Chuan Wang": 0.014045894145965576, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>All papers>>All papers_29>>title>>Movie Ticket, Popcorn, and Another Movie Next Weekend: Time-Aware Service Sequential Recommendation for User Retention": 0.014069557189941406, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_252>>authors>>authors_2>>Justin Cheng and Robert West": 0.014070987701416016, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_171>>authors>>authors_1>>Koby Bibas": 0.014078319072723389, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_277>>authors>>authors_2>>Changhua Pei": 0.014231264591217041, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>All Papers>>All Papers_171>>authors>>authors_2>>Oren Sar Shalom and Dietmar Jannach": 0.014301121234893799}, "What is the role of the peer prediction mechanism in a crowdsourcing setting?": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_6>>abstract>>In this work, we investigate workers’ rating behavior and compare it with experts. First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale.": 0.010657250881195068, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation>>SESSION: Crowdsourcing and Human Computation_5>>abstract>>Evaluating design ideas is necessary to predict their success and assess their impact early on in the process. Existing methods rely either on metrics computed by systems that are effective but subject to errors and bias, or experts’ ratings, which are accurate but expensive and long to collect. Crowdsourcing offers a compelling way to evaluate a large number of design ideas in a short amount of time while being cost-effective.
