They are commonly used to model social networks, knowledge graphs, and protein-protein interaction networks. In this talk we will present the potential of graph generative models and our recent relevant efforts in the biomedical domain. More specifically we present a novel architecture that generates medical records as graphs with privacy guarantees. We capitalize and modify the graph Variational autoencoders (VAEs) architecture. We train the generative model with the well known MIMIC medical database and achieve generated data that are very similar to the real ones yet provide privacy guarantees. We also develop new GNNs for predicting antibiotic resistance and other protein related downstream tasks such as enzymes classifications and Gene Ontology classification. We achieve there as well promising results with potential for future application in broader biomedical related tasks.

While scripts are powerful and convenient, they lack provenance support. With that problem in mind, we designed noWorkflow aiming at transparently and automatically capturing provenance of Python scripts. In its 10 years of existence, it has been used for different purposes. In this talk, we provide an overview of noWorkflow’s evolution throughout the years and analyze myths and truths about it. To do that, we go over the 150+ papers that cite noWorkflow and group their main claims, classifying them as myths or truths.": 0.09279632568359375, "WWW2023>>Program>>Detailed Program>>Sun Apr 30>>Sun Apr 30_10>>event>>Workshop: Machine Learning for Streaming Media": 0.09335732460021973}, "Are there any papers presented by Ioannis Caragiannis in the Research Track: Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_1>>authors>>authors_9>>Kewu Sun and Zhe Ma": 0.12110632658004761, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_12>>title>>Randomized Pricing with Deferred Acceptance for Revenue Maximization with Submodular Objectives": 0.1247941255569458, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_1>>authors>>authors_1>>Bonan Ni": 0.12541240453720093, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_11>>title>>Dynamic Interventions for Networked Contagions": 0.1267608404159546, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_8>>authors>>authors_2>>Zhe Feng and Guru Guruganesh": 0.12797921895980835, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_10>>authors>>authors_1>>Zihan Tan": 0.12880325317382812, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_19>>authors>>authors_5>>Zhihua Zhou and Zheng Cai": 0.12891972064971924, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_19>>authors>>authors_4>>Yuqing Kong": 0.1304592490196228, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_1>>authors>>authors_7>>Liangni Lu": 0.13054031133651733, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets>>Economics, Monetization, and Online Markets_11>>authors>>authors_1>>Marios Papachristou": 0.1322939395904541}, "What is the affiliation of the author Alexander Brinkmann who presented a poster at WWW2023?": {"WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_22>>authors>>authors_2>>affiliation>>Megagon Labs": 0.12084078788757324, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_54>>authors>>authors_1>>affiliation>>Macquarie University": 0.12585365772247314, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_32>>authors>>authors_1>>affiliation>>Purdue University": 0.1272175908088684, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_43>>authors>>authors_3>>affiliation>>Alibaba Group": 0.12839967012405396, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_65>>authors>>authors_1>>affiliation>>Alibaba Group": 0.12891650199890137, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_45>>authors>>authors_4>>affiliation>>Georgia Institute of Technology": 0.1289166808128357, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_31>>authors>>authors_2>>affiliation>>Indiana University Bloomington": 0.12985342741012573, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_41>>authors>>authors_2>>affiliation>>Genify": 0.12985962629318237, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_28>>authors>>authors_4>>affiliation>>Adobe Research": 0.130992591381073, "WWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Posters & Demos>>Accepted Posters & Demos_12>>authors>>authors_2>>affiliation>>Univ.
