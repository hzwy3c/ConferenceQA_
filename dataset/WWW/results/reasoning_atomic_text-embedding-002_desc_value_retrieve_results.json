A paper assignment algorithm then uses these bids (along with other data) to compute a high-quality assignment of reviewers to papers. However, this process has been exploited by malicious reviewers who strategically bid in order to unethically manipulate the paper assignment, crucially undermining the peer review process. For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding. In this work, we collect and publicly release a novel dataset to fill this gap, collected from a mock conference activity where participants were instructed to bid either honestly or maliciously. We further provide a descriptive analysis of the bidding behavior, including our categorization of different strategies employed by participants. Finally, we evaluate the ability of each strategy to manipulate the assignment, and also evaluate the performance of some simple algorithms meant to detect malicious bidding. The performance of these detection algorithms can be taken as a baseline for future research on detecting malicious bidding.": 0.1567404866218567}, "What is the main theme of the Web Sci2023 conference?": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_1>>Trends in globalisation, fragmentation, rejoining, and Balkanisation of the Web": 0.09091836214065552, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Doing Web Science>>Doing Web Science_1>>Data curation, Web archives and stewardship in Web Science": 0.09432005882263184, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Doing Web Science>>Doing Web Science_3>>Analysis and modelling of human vs automatic behavior (e.g., bots)": 0.09812372922897339, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_2>>The architecture and philosophy of the Web": 0.09854906797409058, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Doing Web Science>>Doing Web Science_4>>Analysis of online social and information networks": 0.10081052780151367, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Understanding the Web>>Understanding the Web_3>>Automation and AI in all its manifestations relevant to the Web": 0.10088777542114258, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>The Web and Everyday Life>>The Web and Everyday Life_7>>Health and well-being online": 0.10173207521438599, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Call for Papers>>2023 Emphasis: Inequalities in the Face of Concurrent Crises>>Possible topics>>Making the Web Inclusive>>Making the Web Inclusive_3>>Ethical challenges of technologies, data, algorithms, platforms, and people on the Web": 0.10220938920974731}, "What is the process of reviewing the submitted papers?": {"WWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>TheWebConf 2023 Research Tracks Final Call For Papers (CFP) 'Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility'>>Instructions for authors of research tracks submissions>>ReviewProcess>>ProgramCommitteeReview>>Program Committee (PC) members will self-declare their expertise for each paper (passing knowledge, knowledgeable, expert).
