Existing methods rely either on metrics computed by systems that are effective but subject to errors and bias, or experts’ ratings, which are accurate but expensive and long to collect. Crowdsourcing offers a compelling way to evaluate a large number of design ideas in a short amount of time while being cost-effective. Workers’ evaluation is, however, less reliable and might substantially differ from experts’ evaluation. In this work, we investigate workers’ rating behavior and compare it with experts. First, we instrument a crowdsourcing study where we asked workers to evaluate design ideas from three innovation challenges. We show that workers share similar insights with experts but tend to rate more generously and weigh certain criteria more importantly. Next, we develop a hybrid human-AI approach that combines a machine learning model with crowdsourcing to evaluate ideas. Our approach models workers’ reliability and bias while leveraging ideas’ textual content to train a machine learning model. It is able to incorporate experts’ ratings whenever available, to supervise the model training and infer worker performance. Results show that our framework outperforms baseline methods and requires significantly less training data from experts, thus providing a viable solution for evaluating ideas at scale.\""}, {"query": "What is the concept of 'Smart city hub' as introduced in the paper authored by Tsapadikou Asteria and Leonidas Anthopoulos?", "output": "The concept of 'Smart city hub' (SCHub) introduced in the paper by Tsapadikou Asteria and Leonidas Anthopoulos refers to a new idea that aims to homogenize data, service, human, and material flows in cities.

However, from an auction theoretic perspective, this trend goes against foundational results that suggest that for profit-maximizing bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like marginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA. Therefore, while tCPA bidding may increase the volume of conversions, it may not be the most profitable strategy for bidders according to classical auction theory."}, {"query": "At what given time in CDT does the event happen?", "output": "The event happens at different times.

However, the current lack of immersion in virtual reality displays limits the user’s ability to experience and appreciate its aesthetics. This paper presents a case study of a creative approach taken by a tourist attraction venue in developing a physical network system that allows visitors to enhance VR’s aesthetic aspects based on environmental parameters gathered by external sensors. Our system was collaboratively developed through interviews and sessions with twelve stakeholder groups interested in art and exhibitions. This paper demonstrates how our technological advancements in interaction, immersion and visual attractiveness surpass those of earlier virtual display generations. Through multimodal interaction, we aim to encourage innovation on the Web and create more visually appealing and engaging virtual displays.

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems."}, {"query": "How does the 'Regime-based Implied Stochastic Volatility Model for Crypto Option Pricing' contribute to the field of digital asset options?", "output": "The 'Regime-based Implied Stochastic Volatility Model for Crypto Option Pricing' (MR-ISVM) contributes to the field of digital asset options by providing a more accurate option pricing model for these volatile assets like Bitcoin. This model leverages advances in market regime clustering along with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model on recent data from the Bitcoin options market. By applying this integrated method to high-frequency data on Bitcoin options, it allows for pricing that is based on market participant expectations in an adaptive way, in different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. This model helps to overcome the complexity of adapting to sudden changes in higher order characteristics of option pricing models, and can be applied to new datasets covering previously unexplored digital asset dynamics."}, {"query": "What is the scope of the Web Conference 2023 and what kind of submissions are encouraged?", "output": "The scope of The Web Conference 2023 spans the field of Web and its crucial role in enabling new research and applications.

To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential."}, {"query": "What are the ACM Policies for the article submission to the conference?", "output": "The ACM Policies for article submission to the conference include a strict policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification.
