This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web.",

                    "Introduction": "Fifteen years ago, a 2007 WWW paper entitled “Internet-Scale Collection of Human-Reviewed Data(https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1242572.1242604)” was one of several forerunners to signal a new, emerging area of research on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP). Growing excitement and work in this new area would eventually lead to four years of HCOMP workshops across KDD and AAAI (2009-2012), a new annual AAAI HCOMP conference(https://www.humancomputation.com/) (2013 onward), and a new, annual HCOMP track at the WebConference (2014 onward). Today, the world and research landscape looks remarkably different than it did in 2007, with the Web playing a central role in orchestrating such advances. Of particular note, modern neural models have transformed AI capabilities, along with far greater ubiquity and significance of AI systems now in practical deployment around the world. As one effect of this, the commoditization and democratization of AI models today has also brought a new focus to “data-centric AI” in which AI models can succeed or fail based on the quality of underlying data and human annotations. The nature of human-AI interactions are also continually evolving in response to AI advances, posing an ever-changing frontier of new challenges for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, the growth of AI power has brought a commensurate recognition of the need for responsible AI systems that are fair, accountable, transparent, and trustworthy – across diverse, global communities of human stakeholders who interact with or are impacted by AI systems. Given the central role of HCOMP in AI (creating reliable training and benchmark annotations, as well as enabling hybrid, human-in-the-loop systems), continuing innovation in HCOMP remains a key challenge for the further advancement of AI. HCOMP itself has made tremendous strides forward in the past fifteen years, yet many research challenges remain.",

                    "description": "A large swath of user interaction with various online services happens through devices connected to the World Wide Web. Hence, developing technologies to understand and personalize user experience in applications powered by web data has become one of the most challenging problems for Web researchers and practitioners. Recent advances have enabled the processing of vast amounts of data collected from these devices, using techniques from machine learning, statistical modeling, natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and others. The sheer volume of interactions has also made it possible to innovate and experiment continuously in a data-driven fashion, based on users’ interactions and feedback. Such technology can benefit everyone if it is developed with inclusion at the heart of technical choices, particularly with techniques to mitigate biases that may arise at different stages, from data collection to modeling and evaluation, to system design. In this track, we invite original research submissions addressing all aspects of user modeling, personalization, inclusive modeling, and system design in the context of the Web.",

We especially encourage submissions that propose novel and principled techniques or algorithms that can leverage the special characteristics of the Web, social media, and user behaviors for such extraction and mining. In addition to new techniques and algorithms, we also seek insights gained from the mining process.\nThe major focus of the Web Conference is to address the key challenges of Web-related scientific research. The general theme of the Web conference this year is “Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility​​”. We particularly welcome submissions that align with this theme. Submissions that merely use one or another Web artifact — e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network — rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope of the conference and will be rejected early during the reviewing process.\nPlease note that any submission for the track must make clear the relevance of the paper to the World Wide Web. Papers for which the relation to the World Wide Web is missing or unclear or implicit will be rejected. For instance, a paper on performance improvement of a general operating system would be out of scope even if it implicitly benefits Web servers, but if such a paper explicitly discusses and evaluates the effect of the proposed approaches on web servers then it would be in scope. Please also refer to the general relevance requirements as described in the general TheWebConf'23 Call for Papers.",

Last year, we had the first special track on Web for Good and included the FATES topics. This year, FATES topics are part of the main research program and the Web for Good track will focus on sustainable development and vulnerable populations. Papers that primarily focus on FATES should be submitted to the main research track, not to this track.\nToday’s web and social media solutions do not sufficiently address societal problems related to environmental sustainability, climate action, and vulnerable populations.\nWe seek papers in which web and social media technologies are investigated, developed or applied to these topics, particularly among vulnerable or marginalized communities and the fostering of sustainable development and healthy human societies.",
                    "goal": "The goal of this track is to gather researchers and developers from academia, industry, and civil society to present and debate methods for achieving a Web that is inclusive, non discriminative, sustainable, ethical, open, and that can appropriately address emergent societal challenges towards a Web for Good. To achieve this, we look for contributions that describe research results, tools, design techniques and experiments that are being developed to deal with these topics as well as how to develop new partnerships for the data age (Data Collaboratives) to unlock both data and data science capabilities.",
                    "We welcome any submissions that address the broad goals of this Special Track and look forward to seeing the diverse ways in which authors will approach these themes. We especially encourage submissions in the following areas": [

Initially conceived as a platform to publish and consume hypertext in a distributed fashion, the Web has never stopped growing in content in various forms and media —text, images, sound, music, video, data, and a large et cetera. Traditionally these forms and media have been the natural spaces of human creativity, imagination and invention.",

This started the moment users became content creators, and has grown with the emergence of social platforms tailored to our need to connect and share with others. Throughout my work, I’ve come to appreciate how social media has democratized access to real-world news and social sentiment, while also witnessing the loss of trust created by fake information. As a computer scientist from Chile in Latin America, I have worked on a range of problems that were driven by local needs. Many times, I have tried to apply state of the art solutions to well-known problems, only to find that these don’t work outside of their initial evaluation dataset. In this talk, I’ll discuss how geographical, language, and social diversity have opened new avenues for innovation and better understanding the social Web. I’ll also show that to truly create useful technological solutions, we must develop inclusive research and resources."

Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks.

The Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that. The PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP. Ethernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it.

In this paper, we first point out the three drawbacks of existing similarity-based embedding methods: inaccurate similarity computation, conflicting optimization goal, and impairing in/out-degree distributions. Then, motivated by these drawbacks, we propose AdaSim*, a novel similarity measure for graphs that is conducive to the similarity-based graph embedding. We finally propose GELTOR, an effective embedding method that employs AdaSim* as a node similarity measure and the concept of learning-to-rank in the embedding process. Contrary to existing methods, GELTOR does not learn the similarity scores distribution; instead, for any target node, GELTOR conforms the ranks of its top-t similar nodes in the embedding space to their original ranks based on AdaSim* scores. We conduct extensive experiments with six real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of GELTOR in graph reconstruction, link prediction, and node classification tasks. Our experimental results show that (1) AdaSim* outperforms AdaSim, RWR, and MCT in computing nodes similarity in graphs, (2) our GETLOR outperforms existing state-of-the-arts and conventional embedding methods in most cases of the above machine learning tasks, thereby implying that learning-to-rank is beneficial to graph embedding."

However, with their inherently recursive message propagation among neighboring nodes, existing GNN-based CF models may generate indistinguishable and inaccurate user (item) representations due to the over-smoothing and noise effect with low-pass Laplacian smoothing operators. In addition, the recursive information propagation with the stacked aggregators in the entire graph structures may result in poor scalability in practical applications. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a simple and effective collaborative filtering model (SimRec) that marries the power of knowledge distillation and contrastive learning. In SimRec, adaptive transferring knowledge is enabled between the teacher GNN model and a lightweight student network, to not only preserve the global collaborative signals, but also address the over-smoothing issue with representation recalibration. Empirical results on public datasets show that SimRec archives better efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation performance compared with various strong baselines. Our implementations are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/SimRec."

However, real-world data in web-based applications (e.g., recommendation and advertising) always contains bias, preventing GNNs from learning fair representations. Although many works were proposed to address the fairness issue, they suffer from the significant problem of insufficient learnable knowledge with limited attributes after debiasing. To address this problem, we develop Graph-Fairness Mixture of Experts (G-Fame), a novel plug-and-play method to assist any GNNs to learn distinguishable representations with unbiased attributes. Furthermore, based on G-Fame, we propose G-Fame++, which introduces three novel strategies to improve the representation fairness from node representations, model layer, and parameter redundancy perspectives. In particular, we first present the embedding diversified method to learn distinguishable node representations. Second, we design the layer diversified strategy to maximize the output difference of distinct model layers. Third, we introduce the expert diversified method to minimize expert parameter similarities to learn diverse and complementary representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of G-Fame and G-Fame++ in both accuracy and fairness, compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple graph datasets."

However, existing works focus only on the data augmentation on homogeneous graphs. Data augmentation for heterogeneous graphs remains under-explored. Considering that heterogeneous graphs contain different types of nodes and links, ignoring the type information and directly applying the data augmentation methods of homogeneous graphs to heterogeneous graphs will lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Aspect Heterogeneous Graph Augmentation framework named MAHGA. Specifically, MAHGA consists of two core augmentation strategies: structure-level augmentation and metapath-level augmentation. Structure-level augmentation pays attention to network schema aspect and designs a relation-aware conditional variational auto-encoder that can generate synthetic features of neighbors to augment the nodes and the node types with scarce links. Metapath-level augmentation concentrates on metapath aspect, which constructs metapath reachable graphs for different metapaths and estimates the graphons of them. By sampling and mixing up based on the graphons, MAHGA yields intra-metapath and inter-metapath augmentation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of MAHGA. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the performances across a set of heterogeneous graph learning models and datasets."

We show that there exist sublinear query and time algorithms for testing three key properties of signed graphs: balance (or 2-clusterability), clusterability and signed triangle freeness. We consider both the dense graph model, where one queries the adjacency matrix entries of a signed graph, and the bounded-degree model, where one queries for the neighbors of a node and the sign of the connecting edge. Our algorithms use a variety of tools from unsigned graph property testing, as well as reductions from one setting to the other. Our main technical contribution is a sublinear algorithm for testing clusterability in the bounded-degree model. This contrasts with the property of k-clusterability in unsigned graphs, which is not testable with a sublinear number of queries in the bounded-degree model. We experimentally evaluate the complexity and usefulness of several of our testers on real-life and synthetic datasets."

We address the vulnerability of SGNN to potential edge noise in the input graph. Our goal is to strengthen existing SGNN allowing them to withstand edge noises by extracting robust representations for signed graphs. First, we analyze the expressiveness of SGNN using an extended Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test and identify the limitations to SGNN over triangles that are unbalanced. Then, we design some structure-based regularizers to be used in conjunction with an SGNN that highlight intrinsic properties of a signed graph. The tools and insights above allow us to propose a novel framework, Robust Signed Graph Neural Network (RSGNN), which adopts a dual architecture that simultaneously denoises the graph while learning node representations. We validate the performance of our model empirically on four real-world signed graph datasets, i.e., Bitcoin_OTC, Bitcoin_Alpha, Epinion and Slashdot, RSGNN can clearly improve the robustness of popular SGNN models. When the signed graphs are affected by random noise, our method outperforms baselines by up to 9.35% Binary-F1 for link sign prediction. Our implementation is available in PyTorch1."

Storing a sparse matrix in conventional ways requires an amount of space linear in the number of non-zeros, and lossy compression of sparse matrices (e.g., Truncated SVD) typically requires an amount of space linear in the number of rows and columns. In this work, we propose NeuKron for compressing a sparse reorderable matrix into a constant-size space. NeuKron generalizes Kronecker products using a recurrent neural network with a constant number of parameters. NeuKron updates the parameters so that a given matrix is approximated by the product and reorders the rows and columns of the matrix to facilitate the approximation. The updates take time linear in the number of non-zeros in the input matrix, and the approximation of each entry can be retrieved in logarithmic time. We also extend NeuKron to compress sparse reorderable tensors (e.g. multi-layer graphs), which generalize matrices. Through experiments on ten real-world datasets, we show that NeuKron is (a) Compact: requiring up to five orders of magnitude less space than its best competitor with similar approximation errors, (b) Accurate: giving up to 10 × smaller approximation error than its best competitors with similar size outputs, and (c) Scalable: successfully compressing a matrix with over 230 million non-zero entries."

In this paper, we first analyze how message-passing captures the collaborative effect and propose a recommendation-oriented topological metric, Common Interacted Ratio (CIR), which measures the level of interaction between a specific neighbor of a node with the rest of its neighbors. After demonstrating the benefits of leveraging collaborations from neighbors with higher CIR, we propose a recommendation-tailored GNN, Collaboration-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (CAGCN), that goes beyond 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman(1-WL) test in distinguishing non-bipartite-subgraph-isomorphic graphs.

Therefore, this paper proposes a Pairwise-interactions-based Bayesian Inference method (named PBI) to infer the underlying diffusion network structure. More specifically, to get more accurate inference results, we measure the weights of each candidate pairwise interaction in different cascades and add them to the likelihood of a contagion process. In addition, a pre-pruning work is introduced for candidate edges to further improve the inference efficiency.

The network dismantling task focuses on how to efficiently select the least such critical nodes. Most existing approaches focus on measuring nodes’ importance from either functional or topological viewpoint. Different from theirs, we argue that nodes’ importance can be measured from both of the two complementary aspects: The functional importance can be based on the nodes’ competence in relaying network information; While the topological importance can be measured from nodes’ regional structural patterns. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for network dismantling, called DCRS, which encodes and fuses both node diffusion competence and role significance. Specifically, we propose a graph diffusion neural network which emulates information diffusion for competence encoding; We divide nodes with similar egonet structural patterns into a few roles, and construct a role graph on which to encode node role significance. The DCRS converts and fuses the two encodings to output a final ranking score for selecting critical nodes. Experiments on both real-world networks and synthetic networks demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors for its mostly requiring much fewer nodes to dismantle a network."

On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG), which distils semantic knowledge from multi-source data, has been popular in recent LBSN research, which inspires us to introduce KG for socioeconomic indicator prediction in LBSNs. Specifically, we first construct a location-based KG (LBKG) to integrate various kinds of knowledge from heterogeneous LBSN data, including locations and other related elements like point of interests (POIs), business areas as well as various relationships between them, such as spatial proximity and functional similarity. Then we propose a hierarchical KG learning model to capture both global knowledge from LBKG and domain knowledge from several sub-KGs.

The key ingredients of our randomized algorithm are Laplacian solvers and node sparsifiers, where the latter can preserve pairwise effective resistance by viewing Schur complement as random walks with average length l.

While a very recent model has been proposed to bridge the gap, its performance on unsupervised learning tasks is still unknown. In this paper, to comprehensively enhance the performance of generative graph SSL against other GCL models on both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, we propose the SeeGera model, which is based on the family of self-supervised variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE). Specifically, SeeGera adopts the semi-implicit variational inference framework, a hierarchical variational framework, and mainly focuses on feature reconstruction and structure/feature masking. On the one hand, SeeGera co-embeds both nodes and features in the encoder and reconstructs both links and features in the decoder. Since feature embeddings contain rich semantic information on features, they can be combined with node embeddings to provide fine-grained knowledge for feature reconstruction. On the other hand, SeeGera adds an additional layer for structure/feature masking to the hierarchical variational framework, which boosts the model generalizability. We conduct extensive experiments comparing SeeGera with 9 other state-of-the-art competitors. Our results show that SeeGera can compare favorably against other state-of-the-art GCL methods in a variety of unsupervised and supervised learning tasks."

Tackling with these two factors at the same time is challenging. On the one hand, traditional Euclidean space utilized in previous studies fails to capture hierarchy structures due to a restricted representation ability. On the other hand, the intuitive apply of hyperbolic geometry could extract hierarchical patterns but more emphasis on degree distribution weakens intra- and inter-session collaborations. To address the challenges, we propose a Hierarchy-Aware Dual Clustering Graph Network (HADCG) model for session-based recommendation. Towards the first challenge, we design the hierarchy-aware graph modeling module which converts sessions into hyperbolic session graphs, adopting hyperbolic geometry in propagation and attention mechanism so as to integrate chronological and hierarchical information. As for the second challenge, we introduce the deep dual clustering module which develops a two-level clustering strategy, i.e., information regularizer for intra-session clustering and contrastive learner for inter-session clustering, to enhance hyperbolic representation learning from collaborative perspectives and further promote recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HADCG."

While a number of directed network embedding methods have been proposed, we empirically show that the existing methods lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities against degree-related distributional shifts. To mitigate this problem, we propose ODIN (Out-of-Distribution Generalized Directed Network Embedding), a new directed NE method where we model multiple factors in the formation of directed edges. Then, for each node, ODIN learns multiple embeddings, each of which preserves its corresponding factor, by disentangling interest factors and biases related to in- and out-degrees of nodes. Our experiments on four real-world directed networks demonstrate that disentangling multiple factors enables ODIN to yield out-of-distribution generalized embeddings that are consistently effective under various degrees of shifts in degree distributions. Specifically, ODIN universally outperforms 9 state-of-the-art competitors in 2 LP tasks on 4 real-world datasets under both identical distribution (ID) and non-ID settings.

In this paper, we focus on the benchmark task of HGNNs, i.e., node classification, and empirically find that typical HGNNs are not good at predicting the label of a test node whose receptive field (1) has few training nodes from the same category or (2) has multiple training nodes from different categories. A possible explanation is that their message passing mechanisms may involve noises from different categories, and cannot fully explore task-specific knowledge such as the label dependency between distant nodes. Therefore, instead of introducing a new HGNN model, we propose a general post-training framework that can be applied on any pretrained HGNNs to further inject task-specific knowledge and enhance their prediction performance. Specifically, we first design an auxiliary system that estimates node labels based on (1) a global inference module of multi-channel label propagation and (2) a local inference module of network schema-aware prediction. The mechanism of our auxiliary system can complement the pretrained HGNNs by providing extra task-specific knowledge. During the post-training process, we will strengthen both system-level and module-level consistencies to encourage the cooperation between a pretrained HGNN and our auxiliary system. In this way, both systems can learn from each other for better performance. In experiments, we apply our framework to four typical HGNNs. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that compared with pretrained HGNNs, our post-training framework can enhance Micro-F1 by a relative improvement of on average.

To preserve the heterogeneous semantics on HINs, the rich node/edge types become a cornerstone of HIN representation learning. However, in real-world scenarios, type information is often noisy, missing or inaccessible. Assuming no type information is given, we define a so-called latent heterogeneous graph (LHG), which carries latent heterogeneous semantics as the node/edge types cannot be observed. In this paper, we study the challenging and unexplored problem of link prediction on an LHG. As existing approaches depend heavily on type-based information, they are suboptimal or even inapplicable on LHGs. To address the absence of type information, we propose a model named LHGNN, based on the novel idea of semantic embedding at node and path levels, to capture latent semantics on and between nodes. We further design a personalization function to modulate the heterogeneous contexts conditioned on their latent semantics w.r.t. the target node, to enable finer-grained aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superior performance of LHGNN."

In contrast, silent nodes only have incomplete features and rare labels, e.g., the description and political tendency of politicians (vocal) are abundant while not for ordinary civilians (silent) on the twitter’s social network. Predicting the silent majority remains a crucial yet challenging problem. However, most existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) assume that all nodes belong to the same domain, without considering the missing features and distribution-shift between domains, leading to poor ability to deal with VS-Graph. To combat the above challenges, we propose Knowledge Transferable Graph Neural Network (KTGNN), which models distribution-shifts during message passing and learns representation by transferring knowledge from vocal nodes to silent nodes. Specifically, we design the domain-adapted \"feature completion and message passing mechanism\" for node representation learning while preserving domain difference.

In this paper, we propose a new localization strategy based on finite deployed sensors, named Greedy-coverage-based Rapid Source Localization (GRSL), to rapidly, flexibly and accurately infer the source in the early propagation stage of large-scale networks. There are two phases in GRSL. In the first phase, the Greedy-based Strategy (GS) greedily deploys sensors to rapidly achieve wide area coverage at a low cost. In the second phase, when a propagation event within a network is observed by a part of the sensors, the Inference Strategy (IS) with an earlier response mechanism begins executing the source inference task in an earlier small infected area. Comprehensive experiments with the SOTA methods demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of GRSL in various application scenarios."

Despite their effectiveness, several key challenges have not been well addressed in existing methods: i) Data noise and missing are ubiquitous in many spatio-temporal scenarios due to a variety of factors. ii) Input spatio-temporal data (e.g., mobility traces) usually exhibits distribution heterogeneity across space and time. In such cases, current methods are vulnerable to the quality of the generated region graphs, which may lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges by exploring the Automated Spatio-Temporal graph contrastive learning paradigm (AutoST) over the heterogeneous region graph generated from multi-view data sources. Our AutoST framework is built upon a heterogeneous graph neural architecture to capture the multi-view region dependencies with respect to POI semantics, mobility flow patterns and geographical positions. To improve the robustness of our GNN encoder against data noise and distribution issues, we design an automated spatio-temporal augmentation scheme with a parameterized contrastive view generator. AutoST can adapt to the spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph with multi-view semantics well preserved. Extensive experiments for three downstream spatio-temporal mining tasks on several real-world datasets demonstrate the significant performance gain achieved by our AutoST over a variety of baselines.

Despite the success, existing spectral GNNs usually fail to deal with complex networks (e.g., WWW) due to such homogeneous spectral filtering setting that ignores the regional heterogeneity as typically seen in real-world networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel diverse spectral filtering (DSF) framework, which automatically learns node-specific filter weights to exploit the varying local structure properly. Particularly, the diverse filter weights consist of two components — A global one shared among all nodes, and a local one that varies along network edges to reflect node difference arising from distinct graph parts — to balance between local and global information. As such, not only can the global graph characteristics be captured, but also the diverse local patterns can be mined with awareness of different node positions. Interestingly, we formulate a novel optimization problem to assist in learning diverse filters, which also enables us to enhance any spectral GNNs with our DSF framework. We showcase the proposed framework on three state-of-the-arts including GPR-GNN, BernNet, and JacobiConv. Extensive experiments over 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently boost model performance by up to 4.92% in node classification tasks, producing diverse filters with enhanced interpretability."

To address these challenges, we conduct in-depth explorations on mid-frequency signals on graphs and propose a simple yet effective Mid-pass filter GCN (Mid-GCN).

Specifically, instead of assigning each node with a directly learnable embedding vector, xGCN regards node embeddings as static features. It uses a propagation operation to smooth node embeddings and relies on a Refinement neural Network (RefNet) to transform the coarse embeddings derived from the unsupervised propagation into new ones that optimize a training objective. The output of RefNet, which are well-refined embeddings, will replace the original node embeddings. This process is repeated iteratively until the model converges to a satisfying status. Experiments on three social network datasets with link prediction tasks show that xGCN not only achieves the best accuracy compared with a series of competitive baselines but also is highly efficient and scalable."

Most of the existing methods essentially optimize a Frobenius-like distance or ranking-based loss, ignoring the underlying geometry of graph data. Optimal transport (OT), together with Wasserstein distance, has emerged to be a powerful approach accounting for the underlying geometry explicitly. Promising as it might be, the state-of-the-art OT-based alignment methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) effectiveness due to the insufficient use of topology and consistency information and (2) scalability due to the non-convex formulation and repeated computationally costly loss calculation. In this paper, we propose a position-aware regularized optimal transport framework for network alignment named PARROT. To tackle the effectiveness issue, the proposed PARROT captures topology information by random walk with restart, with three carefully designed consistency regularization terms. To tackle the scalability issue, the regularized OT problem is decomposed into a series of convex subproblems and can be efficiently solved by the proposed constrained proximal point method with guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm achieves significant improvements in both effectiveness and scalability, outperforming the state-of-the-art network alignment methods and speeding up existing OT-based methods by up to 100 times."

Most previous sequential CDR approaches cannot solve the cross-domain sequential recommendation problem well, since (1) they cannot sufficiently depict the users’ actual preferences, (2) they cannot leverage and transfer useful knowledge across domains.

We further propose external alignment optimal transport method in the external domain alignment module to reduce domain discrepancy for the item embeddings. Our empirical studies on Amazon datasets demonstrate that IESRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models."

Most existing uplift methods only use individual data, which are usually not informative enough to capture the unobserved and complex hidden factors regarding the uplift. Furthermore, uplift modeling scenario usually has scarce labeled data, especially for the treatment group, which also poses a great challenge for model training. Considering that the neighbors’ features and the social relationships are very informative to characterize a user’s uplift, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with two uplift estimators, called GNUM, to learn from the social graph for uplift estimation. Specifically, we design the first estimator based on a class-transformed target. The estimator is general for all types of outcomes, and is able to comprehensively model the treatment and control group data together to approach the uplift. When the outcome is discrete, we further design the other uplift estimator based on our defined partial labels, which is able to utilize more labeled data from both the treatment and control groups, to further alleviate the label scarcity problem. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset and two industrial datasets show a superior performance of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods under various evaluation metrics.

While promising, currently most GNN-based fraud detectors fail to generalize to the low homophily setting. Besides, label utilization has been proved to be significant factor for node classification problem. But we find they are less effective in fraud detection tasks due to the low homophily in graphs. In this work, we propose GAGA, a novel Group AGgregation enhanced TrAnsformer, to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, the group aggregation provides a portable method to cope with the low homophily issue. Such an aggregation explicitly integrates the label information to generate distinguishable neighborhood information. Along with group aggregation, an attempt towards end-to-end trainable group encoding is proposed which augments the original feature space with the class labels. Meanwhile, we devise two additional learnable encodings to recognize the structural and relational context. Then, we combine the group aggregation and the learnable encodings into a Transformer encoder to capture the semantic information. Experimental results clearly show that GAGA outperforms other competitive graph-based fraud detectors by up to 24.39% on two trending public datasets and a real-world industrial dataset from Baidu. Even more, the group aggregation is demonstrated to outperform other label utilization methods (e.g., C&S, BoT/UniMP) in the low homophily setting."

To reduce labeling requirement, the “pre-train, fine-tune” and “pre-train, prompt” paradigms have become increasingly common. In particular, prompting is a popular alternative to fine-tuning in natural language processing, which is designed to narrow the gap between pre-training and downstream objectives in a task-specific manner. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is still limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template, but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner.

Existing works have demonstrated that structural information and temporal information are two of the most important information for this problem. However, existing works either focus on modeling them independently or modeling the temporal dynamics of a single structural scale, neglecting the complex correlations among them. This paper proposes to model the inherent correlations among the evolving dynamics of different structural scales for dynamic link prediction. Following this idea, we propose an Attentional Multi-scale Co-evolving Network (AMCNet). Specifically, We model multi-scale structural information by a motif-based graph neural network with multi-scale pooling. Then, we design a hierarchical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model for learning the complex correlations among the evolution dynamics of different structural scales. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets with different characteristics demonstrate that AMCNet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in both single-step and multi-step dynamic link prediction tasks."

The detection operation leverages a graph autoencoder, which does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the local corruptions.

Though researchers have proposed various CDR methods to effectively transfer knowledge across domains, they fail to address the following key issues, i.e., (1) they cannot model high-order correlations among users and items in every single domain to obtain more accurate representations; (2) they cannot model the correlations among items across different domains. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Intra and Inter Domain HyperGraph Convolutional Network (II-HGCN) framework, which includes two main layers in the modeling process, i.e., the intra-domain layer and the inter-domain layer. In the intra-domain layer, we design a user hypergraph and an item hypergraph to model high-order correlations inside every single domain. Thus we can address the data sparsity problem better and learn high-quality representations of users and items. In the inter-domain layer, we propose an inter-domain hypergraph structure to explore correlations among items from different domains based on their interactions with common users. Therefore we can not only transfer the knowledge of users but also combine embeddings of items across domains. Comprehensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that II-HGCN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially when datasets are extremely sparse."

For the graph, a significant challenge is that the topological properties of the nodes (e.g., locations, roles) are unbalanced (topology-imbalance), other than the number of training labeled nodes (quantity-imbalance). Existing studies on topology-imbalance focus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring the global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In the real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals important topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of applications. We find that training labeled nodes with different hierarchical properties have a significant impact on the node classification tasks and confirm it in our experiments. It is well known that hyperbolic geometry has a unique advantage in representing the hierarchical structure of graphs. Therefore, we attempt to explore the hierarchy-imbalance issue for node classification of graph neural networks with a novelty perspective of hyperbolic geometry, including its characteristics and causes. Then, we propose a novel hyperbolic geometric hierarchy-imbalance learning framework, named HyperIMBA, to alleviate the hierarchy-imbalance issue caused by uneven hierarchy-levels and cross-hierarchy connectivity patterns of labeled nodes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of HyperIMBA for hierarchy-imbalance node classification tasks."

Although they achieve superior performances in many tasks, propagation-based GNNs possess three essential drawbacks. Firstly, the propagation tends to produce smooth effect, which meets the inductive bias of homophily, and causes two serious issues: over-smoothing issue and performance drop on networks with heterophily. Secondly, the propagations to each node are irrelevant, which prevents GNNs from modeling high-order relation, and cause the GNNs fragile to the attributes noises. Thirdly, propagation-based GNNs may be fragile to topology noise, since they heavily relay on propagation over the topology. Therefore, the propagation, as the key component of most GNNs, may be the essence of some serious issues in GNNs. To get to the root of these issue, this paper attempts to replace the propagation with a novel local operation. Quantitative experimental analysis reveals: 1) the existence of low-rank characteristic in the node attributes from ego-networks and 2) the performance improvement by reducing its rank. Motivated by this finding, this paper propose the Low-Rank GNNs, whose key component is the low-rank attribute matrix approximation in ego-network. The graph topology is employed to construct the ego-networks instead of message propagation, which is sensitive to topology noises. The proposed Low-Rank GNNs posses some attractive characteristics, including robust to topology and attribute noises, parameter-free and parallelizable. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superior performance, robustness to noises and universality of the proposed Low-Rank GNNs."

To better learn dynamic node embeddings that vary over time, researchers have proposed a series of temporal graph neural networks for TIGs. However, due to the entangled temporal and structural dependencies, existing methods have to process the sequence of events chronologically and consecutively to ensure node representations are up-to-date. This prevents existing models from parallelization and reduces their flexibility in industrial applications. To tackle the above challenge, in this paper, we propose TIGER, a TIG embedding model that can restart at any timestamp. We introduce a restarter module that generates surrogate representations acting as the warm initialization of node representations. By restarting from multiple timestamps simultaneously, we divide the sequence into multiple chunks and naturally enable the parallelization of the model. Moreover, in contrast to previous models that utilize a single memory unit, we introduce a dual memory module to better exploit neighborhood information and alleviate the staleness problem. Extensive experiments on four public datasets and one industrial dataset are conducted, and the results verify both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our work."

One critical objective of GCL is to retain original graph information. For this purpose, we design an encoder based on the idea of unsupervised dimensionality reduction of locally linear embedding (LLE). Specifically, we map one iteration of the LLE to one layer of the network. To guide the encoder to better retain the original graph information, we propose an unbalanced contrastive model consisting of two views, which are the learning view and the teaching view, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the nodes that are identical in muti-views as positive node pairs, and design the node similarity scorer so that the model can select positive samples of a target node. Extensive experiments have been conducted over multiple datasets to evaluate the performance of GraphTL in comparison with baseline models.

This paper proposes a general GSL framework, SE-GSL, through structural entropy and the graph hierarchy abstracted in the encoding tree. Particularly, we exploit the one-dimensional structural entropy to maximize embedded information content when auxiliary neighbourhood attributes is fused to enhance the original graph. A new scheme of constructing optimal encoding trees are proposed to minimize the uncertainty and noises in the graph whilst assuring proper community partition in hierarchical abstraction. We present a novel sample-based mechanism for restoring the graph structure via node structural entropy distribution. It increases the connectivity among nodes with larger uncertainty in lower-level communities. SE-GSL is compatible with various GNN models and enhances the robustness towards noisy and heterophily structures.

Recently, heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) has shown great potential in learning on HG. Current studies of HGNN mainly focus on some HGs with strong homophily properties (nodes connected by meta-path tend to have the same labels), while few discussions are made in those that are less homophilous. Recently, there have been many works on homogeneous graphs with heterophily. However, due to heterogeneity, it is non-trivial to extend their approach to deal with HGs with heterophily. In this work, based on empirical observations, we propose a meta-path-induced metric to measure the homophily degree of a HG. We also find that current HGNNs may have degenerated performance when handling HGs with less homophilous properties. Thus it is essential to increase the generalization ability of HGNNs on non-homophilous HGs. To this end, we propose HDHGR, a homophily-oriented deep heterogeneous graph rewiring approach that modifies the HG structure to increase the performance of HGNN. We theoretically verify HDHGR. In addition, experiments on real-world HGs demonstrate the effectiveness of HDHGR, which brings at most more than 10% relative gain."

However, existing methods are mainly built upon uniform Euclidean space, which has been found to be conflict with the power-law distributions of real-world graphs and unable to represent the hierarchical connections between nodes effectively. With respect to the special data characteristic, hyperbolic geometry offers an ideal alternative due to its exponential expansion property. In this paper, we propose HGWaveNet, a novel hyperbolic graph neural network that fully exploits the fitness between hyperbolic spaces and data distributions for temporal link prediction. Specifically, we design two key modules to learn the spatial topological structures and temporal evolutionary information separately. On the one hand, a hyperbolic diffusion graph convolution (HDGC) module effectively aggregates information from a wider range of neighbors. On the other hand, the internal order of causal correlation between historical states is captured by hyperbolic dilated causal convolution (HDCC) modules. The whole model is built upon the hyperbolic spaces to preserve the hierarchical structural information in the entire data flow. To prove the superiority of HGWaveNet, extensive experiments are conducted on six real-world graph datasets and the results show a relative improvement by up to 6.67% on AUC for temporal link prediction over SOTA methods."

In the node classification task, existing Graph Transformers with Positional Encodings are limited by the following issues: (i) PEs describing the node’s positional identities are insufficient for the node classification task on complex graphs, where a full portrayal of the local node property is needed. (ii) PEs for graphs are integrated with Transformers in a constant schema, resulting in the ignorance of local patterns that may vary among different nodes. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Transformer (AGT) to tackle above issues. AGT consists of a Learnable Centrality Encoding and a Kernelized Local Structure Encoding. The two modules extract structural patterns from centrality and subgraph views in a learnable and scalable manner. Further, we design the Adaptive Transformer Block to adaptively integrate the attention scores and Structural Encodings in a node-specific manner.

Then, we transform CMID into a node classification problem and propose Social-based Multimedia Feature Extractor (SMFE) and Content-aware Multi-channel Influence Propagation (CMIP) to jointly learn the user preferences on multimedia contents and predict the susceptibility of users. Furthermore, we prove that CMINet preserves monotonicity and submodularity, thus enabling (1 − 1/e)-approximate solutions for influence maximization. Experimental results manifest that CMINet outperforms eleven baselines on three public datasets."

The non-IIDness of data across local clients has been a major challenge for FL. In graphs, one specifically important perspective of non-IIDness is manifested in the link-type heterogeneity underlying homogeneous graphs– the seemingly uniform links captured in most real-world networks can carry different levels of homophily or semantics of relations, while the exact sets and distributions of such latent link-types can further differ across local clients. Through our preliminary data analysis, we are motivated to design a new graph FL framework that can simultaneously discover latent link-types and model message-passing w.r.t. the discovered link-types through the collaboration of distributed local clients. Specifically, we propose a framework FedLit that can dynamically detect the latent link-types during FL via an EM-based clustering algorithm and differentiate the message-passing through different types of links via multiple convolution channels. For experiments, we synthesize multiple realistic datasets of graphs with latent heterogeneous link-types from real-world data, and partition them with different levels of link-type heterogeneity. Comprehensive experimental results and in-depth analysis have demonstrated both superior performance and rational behaviors of our proposed techniques."

While recent works on T-GRL have improved link prediction accuracy in temporal settings, their methods optimize a point-wise loss function independently over future links rather than optimize jointly over a candidate set per node. In applications where resources (e.g., attention) are allocated based on ranking links by likelihood, the use of a ranking loss is preferred. However it is not straightforward to develop a T-GRL method to optimize a ranking loss due to a tradeoff between model expressivity and scalability. In this work, we address these issues and propose a Temporal Graph network for Ranking (TGRank), which significantly improves performance for link prediction tasks by (i) optimizing a list-wise loss for improved ranking, and (ii) incorporating a labeling approach designed to allow for efficient inference over the candidate set jointly, while provably boosting expressivity. We extensively evaluate TGRank over six real networks. TGRank outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on average by 14.21%↑ (transductive) and 16.25% ↑ (inductive) in ranking metrics while being more efficient (up-to 65 × speed-up) to make inference on large networks."

Our method assumes that we have different classes of nodes and that we know the class label of some, very few nodes for every class. Guided by this type of supervision, SSAMN learns a low-dimensional representation incorporating all information in a large labeled multiplex network. SSAMN integrates techniques from Spectral Embedding and Homogeneity Analysis to improve the embedding of nodes, node attributes, and node labels. Our experiments demonstrate that we only need very few labels per class in order to have a final embedding that preservers the information of the graph. To evaluate the performance of SSAMN, we run experiments on four real-world datasets.

Currently, shallow GNNs are more common due to the well-known over-smoothing problem facing deeper GNNs. However, they are sub-optimal without utilizing the information from distant nodes, i.e., the long-range dependencies. The mainstream methods in the graph classification task can extract the long-range dependencies either by designing the pooling operations or incorporating the higher-order neighbors, while they have evident drawbacks by modifying the original graph structure, which may result in information loss in graph structure learning. In this paper, by justifying the smaller influence of the over-smoothing problem in the graph classification task, we evoke the importance of stacking-based GNNs and then employ them to capture the long-range dependencies without modifying the original graph structure. To achieve this, two design needs are given for stacking-based GNNs, i.e., sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes. By transforming the two design needs into designing data-specific inter-layer connections, we propose a novel approach with the help of neural architecture search (NAS), which is dubbed LRGNN (Long-Range Graph Neural Networks). Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed LRGNN can achieve the best performance, and obtained data-specific GNNs with different depth and skip-connection schemes, which can better capture the long-range dependencies. 1"

Hinging on the global range attention mechanism, GTs have shown a superpower for representation learning on homogeneous graphs. However, the investigation of GTs on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is still under-exploited. In particular, on account of the existence of heterogeneity, HINs show distinct data characteristics and thus require different treatment. To bridge this gap, in this paper we investigate the representation learning on HINs with Graph Transformer, and propose a novel model named HINormer, which capitalizes on a larger-range aggregation mechanism for node representation learning. In particular, assisted by two major modules, i.e., a local structure encoder and a heterogeneous relation encoder, HINormer can capture both the structural and heterogeneous information of nodes on HINs for comprehensive node representations. We conduct extensive experiments on four HIN benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art."

However, existing graph NAS methods mainly work under the homophily assumption and overlook another important graph property, i.e., heterophily, which exists widely in various real-world applications. To date, automated heterophilic graph learning with NAS is still a research blank to be filled in. Due to the complexity and variety of heterophilic graphs, the critical challenge of heterophilic graph NAS mainly lies in developing the heterophily-specific search space and strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel automated graph neural network on heterophilic graphs, namely Auto-HeG, to automatically build heterophilic GNN models with expressive learning abilities. Specifically, Auto-HeG incorporates heterophily into all stages of automatic heterophilic graph learning, including search space design, supernet training, and architecture selection. Through the diverse message-passing scheme with joint micro-level and macro-level designs, we first build a comprehensive heterophilic GNN search space, enabling Auto-HeG to integrate complex and various heterophily of graphs. With a progressive supernet training strategy, we dynamically shrink the initial search space according to layer-wise variation of heterophily, resulting in a compact and efficient supernet. Taking a heterophily-aware distance criterion as the guidance, we conduct heterophilic architecture selection in the leave-one-out pattern, so that specialized and expressive heterophilic GNN architectures can be derived. Extensive experiments illustrate the superiority of Auto-HeG in developing excellent heterophilic GNNs to human-designed models and graph NAS models."

Although many attack methods have been proposed, they mainly focus on fixed-budget attacks, aiming at finding the most adversarial perturbations within a fixed budget for target node. However, considering the varied robustness of each node, there is an inevitable dilemma caused by the fixed budget, i.e., no successful perturbation is found when the budget is relatively small, while if it is too large, the yielding redundant perturbations will hurt the invisibility. To break this dilemma, we propose a new type of topology attack, named minimum-budget topology attack, aiming to adaptively find the minimum perturbation sufficient for a successful attack on each node. To this end, we propose an attack model, named MiBTack, based on a dynamic projected gradient descent algorithm, which can effectively solve the involving non-convex constraint optimization on discrete topology. Extensive results on three GNNs and four real-world datasets show that MiBTack can successfully lead all target nodes misclassified with the minimum perturbation edges. Moreover, the obtained minimum budget can be used to measure node robustness, so we can explore the relationships of robustness, topology, and uncertainty for nodes, which is beyond what the current fixed-budget topology attacks can offer."

It aims to infer knowledge for (the things at) unobserved locations using the data from (the things at) observed locations during a given time period of interest. This problem essentially requires inductive learning. Once trained, the model should be able to perform kriging for different locations including newly given ones, without retraining. However, it is challenging to perform accurate kriging results because of the heterogeneous spatial relations and diverse temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive graph representation learning model for spatio-temporal kriging. We first encode heterogeneous spatial relations between the unobserved and observed locations by their spatial proximity, functional similarity, and transition probability. Based on each relation, we accurately aggregate the information of most correlated observed locations to produce inductive representations for the unobserved locations, by jointly modeling their similarities and differences. Then, we design relation-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to adaptively capture the temporal correlations in the generated sequence representations for each relation. Finally, we propose a multi-relation attention mechanism to dynamically fuse the complex spatio-temporal information at different time steps from multiple relations to compute the kriging output. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently, and the advantage is more significant when there are fewer observed locations.

At present, graph neural networks (GNNs) for session-based recommendations normally can only recommend items existing in users’ historical sessions. As a result, these GNNs have difficulty recommending items that users have never interacted with (new items), which leads to a phenomenon of information cocoon. Therefore, it is necessary to recommend new items to users. As there is no interaction between new items and users, we cannot include new items when building session graphs for GNN session-based recommender systems. Thus, it is challenging to recommend new items for users when using GNN-based methods. We regard this challenge as “GNN Session-based New Item Recommendation (GSNIR)”. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-intent enhanced graph neural network for it. Due to the fact that new items are not tied to historical sessions, the users’ intent is difficult to predict. We design a dual-intent network to learn user intent from an attention mechanism and the distribution of historical data respectively, which can simulate users’ decision-making process in interacting with a new item. To solve the challenge that new items cannot be learned by GNNs, inspired by zero-shot learning (ZSL), we infer the new item representation in GNN space by using their attributes. By outputting new item probabilities, which contain recommendation scores of the corresponding items, the new items with higher scores are recommended to users. Experiments on two representative real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method. The case study from the real-world verifies interpretability benefits brought by the dual-intent module and the new item reasoning module."

Through a back-and-forth dialogue, users can quickly hone in on just the right items. Many approaches to conversational recommendation, however, only partially explore the user preference space and make limiting assumptions about how user feedback can be best incorporated, resulting in long dialogues and poor recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel conversational recommendation framework with two unique features: (i) a greedy NDCG attribute selector, to enhance user personalization in the interactive preference elicitation process by prioritizing attributes that most effectively represent the actual preference space of the user; and (ii) a user representation refiner, to effectively fuse together the user preferences collected from the interactive elicitation process to obtain a more personalized understanding of the user. Through extensive experiments on four frequently used datasets, we find the proposed framework not only outperforms all the state-of-the-art conversational recommenders (in terms of both recommendation performance and conversation efficiency), but also provides a more personalized experience for the user under the proposed multi-groundtruth multi-round conversational recommendation setting."

We formulate a WWW problem, i.e., within a specific time period (When) and potential travel area (Where), which hotels should be recommended to a certain group of users with similar travel intentions (Why). We identify three critical challenges in solving the WWW problem: user groups generation, travel data sparsity and utilization of hotel recommendation information (e.g., period, location and intention). To this end, we propose LINet, a Location and Intention-aware neural Network for hotel group recommendation. Specifically, LINet first identifies user travel intentions for user groups generalization, and then characterizes the group preferences by jointly considering historical user-hotel interaction and spatio-temporal features of hotels. For data sparsity, we develop a graph neural network, which employs long-term data, and further design an auxiliary loss function of location that efficiently exploits data within the same and across different locations. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LINet when compared with state-of-the-art methods. LINet has been successfully deployed on Fliggy to retrieve high quality hotels for business development, serving hundreds of hotel operation scenarios and thousands of hotel operators."

Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised learning in alleviating label scarcity issue, we explore deriving self-supervision signals with effectively learning of modality-aware user preference and cross-modal dependencies. To this end, we propose a new Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Learning (MMSSL) method which tackles two key challenges.

In addition, to capture the effects that user’s modality-aware interaction pattern would interweave with each other, a cross-modal contrastive learning approach is introduced to jointly preserve the inter-modal semantic commonality and user preference diversity. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method in offering great potential for multimedia recommendation over various state-of-the-art baselines.

However, it is exceedingly costly because it requires resources and inference latency proportional to the number of models, which remains the bottleneck for production. Our work aims to transfer the ensemble knowledge of heterogeneous teachers to a lightweight student model using knowledge distillation (KD), to reduce the huge inference costs while retaining high accuracy. Through an empirical study, we find that the efficacy of distillation severely drops when transferring knowledge from heterogeneous teachers. Nevertheless, we show that an important signal to ease the difficulty can be obtained from the teacher’s training trajectory. This paper proposes a new KD framework, named HetComp, that guides the student model by transferring easy-to-hard sequences of knowledge generated from the teachers’ trajectories. To provide guidance according to the student’s learning state, HetComp uses dynamic knowledge construction to provide progressively difficult ranking knowledge and adaptive knowledge transfer to gradually transfer finer-grained ranking information. Our comprehensive experiments show that HetComp significantly improves the distillation quality and the generalization of the student model."

Nevertheless, the reasons for the effectiveness of Hard Negative Sampling (HNS) have not been revealed yet. In this work, we fill the research gap by conducting thorough theoretical analyses on HNS. Firstly, we prove that employing HNS on the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) learner is equivalent to optimizing One-way Partial AUC (OPAUC). Concretely, the BPR equipped with Dynamic Negative Sampling (DNS) is an exact estimator, while with softmax-based sampling is a soft estimator. Secondly, we prove that OPAUC has a stronger connection with Top-K evaluation metrics than AUC and verify it with simulation experiments. These analyses establish the theoretical foundation of HNS in optimizing Top-K recommendation performance for the first time. On these bases, we offer two insightful guidelines for effective usage of HNS: 1) the sampling hardness should be controllable, e.g., via pre-defined hyper-parameters, to adapt to different Top-K metrics and datasets; 2) the smaller the K we emphasize in Top-K evaluation metrics, the harder the negative samples we should draw. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks verify the two guidelines."

Recent success of Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) in CF demonstrates the effectiveness of modeling high-order relationships through graphs, while repetitive graph convolution and iterative batch optimization limit their efficiency. Instead, item similarity models attempt to construct direct relationships through efficient interaction encoding. Despite their great performance, the growing item numbers result in quadratic growth in similarity modeling process, posing critical scalability problems. In this paper, we investigate the graph sampling strategy adopted in latest GCN model for efficiency improving, and identify the potential item group structure in the sampled graph. Based on this, we propose a novel item similarity model which introduces graph partitioning to restrict the item similarity modeling within each partition. Specifically, we show that the spectral information of the original graph is well in preserving global-level information. Then, it is added to fine-tune local item similarities with a new data augmentation strategy acted as partition-aware prior knowledge, jointly to cope with the information loss brought by partitioning. Experiments carried out on 4 datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art GCN models with 10x speed-up and item similarity models with 95% parameter storage savings."

The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to stabilize the learning process.

Besides the user-item interaction graph, existing state-of-the-art methods usually use auxiliary graphs (e.g., user-user or item-item relation graph) to augment the learned representations of users and/or items. These representations are often propagated and aggregated on auxiliary graphs using graph convolutional networks, which can be prohibitively expensive in computation and memory, especially for large graphs. Moreover, existing multi-modal recommendation methods usually leverage randomly sampled negative examples in Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to guide the learning of user/item representations, which increases the computational cost on large graphs and may also bring noisy supervision signals into the training process. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-modal recommendation model, dubbed BM3, which requires neither augmentations from auxiliary graphs nor negative samples. Specifically, BM3 first bootstraps latent contrastive views from the representations of users and items with a simple dropout augmentation. It then jointly optimizes three multi-modal objectives to learn the representations of users and items by reconstructing the user-item interaction graph and aligning modality features under both inter- and intra-modality perspectives. BM3 alleviates both the need for contrasting with negative examples and the complex graph augmentation from an additional target network for contrastive view generation. We show BM3 outperforms prior recommendation models on three datasets with number of nodes ranging from 20K to 200K, while achieving a 2-9 × reduction in training time.

We argue that current KT modeling, as well as training paradigm, can lead to models tracing patterns of learner’s learning activities, instead of their evolving knowledge states. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, Diagnostic Transformer (DTransformer), along with a new training paradigm, to tackle this challenge. With DTransformer, we build the architecture from question-level to knowledge-level, explicitly diagnosing learner’s knowledge proficiency from each question mastery states. We also propose a novel training algorithm based on contrastive learning that focuses on maintaining the stability of the knowledge state diagnosis. Through extensive experiments, we will show that with its understanding of knowledge state evolution, DTransformer achieves a better performance prediction accuracy and more stable knowledge state tracing results.

Users sequentially interact with the system and provide complex and multi-faceted responses, including WatchTime  and various types of interactions with multiple videos. On the one hand, the platforms aim at optimizing the users’ cumulative WatchTime  (main goal) in the long term, which can be effectively optimized by Reinforcement Learning. On the other hand, the platforms also need to satisfy the constraint of accommodating the responses of multiple user interactions (auxiliary goals) such as Like, Follow, Share, etc. In this paper, we formulate the problem of short video recommendation as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). We find that traditional constrained reinforcement learning algorithms fail to work well in this setting. We propose a novel two-stage constrained actor-critic method: At stage one, we learn individual policies to optimize each auxiliary signal. In stage two, we learn a policy to (i) optimize the main signal and (ii) stay close to policies learned in the first stage, which effectively guarantees the performance of this main policy on the auxiliaries. Through extensive offline evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over alternatives in both optimizing the main goal as well as balancing the others. We further show the advantage of our method in live experiments of short video recommendations, where it significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of both WatchTime  and interactions.

Among different explainable strategies, generating natural language explanations is an important method, which can deliver more informative, flexible and readable explanations to facilitate better user decisions. Despite the effectiveness, existing models are mostly optimized based on the observed datasets, which can be skewed due to the selection or exposure bias. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we formulate the task of explainable recommendation with a causal graph, and design a causality enhanced framework to generate unbiased explanations. More specifically, we firstly define an ideal unbiased learning objective, and then derive a tractable loss for the observational data based on the inverse propensity score (IPS), where the key is a sample re-weighting strategy for equalizing the loss and ideal objective in expectation. Considering that the IPS estimated from the sparse and noisy recommendation datasets can be inaccurate, we introduce a fault tolerant mechanism by minimizing the maximum loss induced by the sample weights near the IPS. For more comprehensive modeling, we further analyze and infer the potential latent confounders induced by the complex and diverse user personalities. We conduct extensive experiments by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods based on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

One popular paradigm is to employ overlapping user representations to establish domain connections, thereby improving recommendation performance in all scenarios. Nevertheless, the general practice of this approach is to train user embeddings in each domain separately and then aggregate them in a plain manner, often ignoring potential cross-domain similarities between users and items. Furthermore, considering that their training objective is recommendation task-oriented without specific regularizations, the optimized embeddings disregard the interest alignment among user’s views, and even violate the user’s original interest distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation framework, namely COAST, to improve recommendation performance on dual domains by perceiving the cross-domain similarity between entities and aligning user interests. Specifically, we first construct a unified cross-domain heterogeneous graph and redefine the message passing mechanism of graph convolutional networks to capture high-order similarity of users and items across domains. Targeted at user interest alignment, we develop deep insights from two more fine-grained perspectives of user-user and user-item interest invariance across domains by virtue of affluent unsupervised and semantic signals. We conduct intensive experiments on multiple tasks, constructed from two large recommendation data sets. Extensive results show COAST consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation algorithms as well as classic single-domain recommendation methods."

For the second one, we firstly change the original samples towards the direction of maximizing the loss function, and then produce the data based on the altered samples to make more effective explorations. Based on both of the above strategies, we leverage adversarial training to optimize the recommender model with the generated data which can achieve the largest losses. In addition, we theoretically analyze our framework, and find that the above two data augmentation strategies equal to impose a gradient based regularization on the original recommender models.

Therefore, simulating human activities to produce massive high-quality data is of great importance to benefit practical applications. However, existing solutions, including rule-based methods with simplified assumptions of human behavior and data-driven methods directly fitting real-world data, both cannot fully qualify for matching reality. In this paper, motivated by the classic psychological theory, Maslow’s need theory describing human motivation, we propose a knowledge-driven simulation framework based on generative adversarial imitation learning. To enhance the fidelity and utility of the generated activity data, our core idea is to model the evolution of human needs as the underlying mechanism that drives activity generation in the simulation model. Specifically, this is achieved by a hierarchical model structure that disentangles different need levels, and the use of neural stochastic differential equations that successfully captures piecewise-continuous characteristics of need dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of data fidelity and utility.

One of the effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click behaviors, but this is not elegant in the video feed recommendation where users are passive in receiving the streaming contents and return skip or no-skip behaviors. Here skip and no-skip behaviors can be treated as negative and positive feedback, respectively. With the mixture of positive and negative feedback, it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of behavioral sequence. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer, which may be inelegant because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not consider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest Factorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR) consisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer and prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose each head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations. Then we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific head interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the relation between different types of feedback. Additionally, we propose a dual-interest disentangling layer to decouple positive and negative interests before performing disentanglement on their representations. Finally, we evolve the positive and negative interests by corresponding towers whose outputs are contrastive by BPR loss.

However, since the training of the cold-start recommendation models is conducted on warm datasets, the existent methods face the issue that the collaborative embeddings of items will be blurred, which significantly degenerates the performance of cold-start item recommendation. To address this issue, we propose a novel model called Contrastive Collaborative Filtering for Cold-start item Recommendation (CCFCRec), which capitalizes on the co-occurrence collaborative signals in warm training data to alleviate the issue of blurry collaborative embeddings for cold-start item recommendation. In particular, we devise a contrastive collaborative filtering (CF) framework, consisting of a content CF module and a co-occurrence CF module to generate the content-based collaborative embedding and the co-occurrence collaborative embedding for a training item, respectively. During the joint training of the two CF modules, we apply a contrastive learning between the two collaborative embeddings, by which the knowledge about the co-occurrence signals can be indirectly transferred to the content CF module, so that the blurry collaborative embeddings can be rectified implicitly by the memorized co-occurrence collaborative signals during the applying phase. Together with the sound theoretical analysis, the extensive experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.

However, in real practice, downstream data users can be interested in various protected groups and these are usually not known as prior. This requires the learned representations to be fair w.r.t. all possible sensitive attributes. We name this task universal fair representation learning, in which an exponential number of sensitive attributes need to be dealt with, bringing the challenges of unreasonable computational cost and un-guaranteed fairness constraints.

An effective bound is first derived via the lens of mutual information to guarantee parity of the universal set of sensitive attributes while maintaining the accuracy of downstream tasks. We also theoretically establish that the number of sensitive attributes that need to be processed can be reduced from exponential to linear. Experiments on two public real-world datasets demonstrate CUFRL can achieve significantly better accuracy-fairness trade-off compared with baseline approaches."

However, it is challenging to explore multi-behavior data due to the unbalanced data distribution and sparse target behavior, which lead to the inadequate modeling of high-order relations when treating multi-behavior data “as features” and gradient conflict in multi-task learning when treating multi-behavior data “as labels”. In this paper, we propose CIGF, a Compressed Interaction Graph based Framework, to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we design a novel Compressed Interaction Graph Convolution Network (CIGCN) to model instance-level high-order relations explicitly. To alleviate the potential gradient conflict when treating multi-behavior data “as labels”, we propose a Multi-Expert with Separate Input (MESI) network with separate input on the top of CIGCN for multi-task learning.

However, these causes widely exist in the real world, and few studies have investigated their role in SBRSs. In this work, we analyze the causalities and correlations of the OSCs in SBRSs from the perspective of causal inference. We find that the OSCs are essentially the confounders in SBRSs, which leads to spurious correlations in the data used to train SBRS models. To address this problem, we propose a novel SBRS framework named COCO-SBRS (COunterfactual COllaborative Session-Based Recommender Systems) to learn the causality between OSCs and user-item interactions in SBRSs. COCO-SBRS first adopts a self-supervised approach to pre-train a recommendation model by designing pseudo-labels of causes for each user’s selection of the item in data to guide the training process. Next, COCO-SBRS adopts counterfactual inference to recommend items based on the outputs of the pre-trained recommendation model considering the causalities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. As a result, COCO-SBRS can learn the causalities in data, preventing the model from learning spurious correlations. The experimental results of our extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over ten representative SBRSs."

Conventional graph neural network based methods usually deal with each domain separately, or train a shared model to serve all domains. The former fails to leverage users’ cross-domain behaviors, making the behavior sparseness issue a great obstacle. The latter learns shared user representation with respect to all domains, which neglects users’ domain-specific preferences. In this paper we propose , a hierarchical hypergraph network based correlative preference transfer framework for MDR, which represents multi-domain user-item interactions into a unified graph to help preference transfer. incorporates two hyperedge-based modules, namely dynamic item transfer (Hyper-I) and adaptive user aggregation (Hyper-U). Hyper-I extracts correlative information from multi-domain user-item feedbacks for eliminating domain discrepancy of item representations. Hyper-U aggregates users’ scattered preferences in multiple domains and further exploits the high-order (not only pair-wise) connections to improve user representations.

In addition, we design an alternate two-phase optimization strategy to train and validate the AutoDenoise properly. In the searching phase, we aim to train the policy network with the capacity of instance denoising; in the validation phase, we find out and evaluate the denoised subset of data instances selected by the trained policy network, so as to validate its denoising ability.

Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does not perform equally well for different user groups according to users’ sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to improve fairness. Given each real original user-item interaction record, we propose the following hypotheses for augmenting the training data: each user in one group has a similar item preference (click or non-click) as the item preference of any user in the remaining group. With these hypotheses, we generate “fake\" interaction behaviors to complement the original training data. After that, we design a bi-level optimization target, with the inner optimization generates better fake data to augment training data with our hypotheses, and the outer one updates the recommendation model parameters based on the augmented training data. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FDA."

Instead of using a fixed modulation function and deciding modulation position by expertise, we propose a modulation framework called ColdNAS for user cold-start problem, where we look for proper modulation structure, including function and position, via neural architecture search. We design a search space which covers broad models and theoretically prove that this search space can be transformed to a much smaller space, enabling an efficient and robust one-shot search algorithm.

However, EASE suffers from several major shortcomings. First, the training and inference of EASE can not scale with the increasing number of items since it requires storing and inverting a large dense matrix; Second, though its optimization objective – the square loss– can yield a closed-form solution, it is not consistent with recommendation goal – predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items, so that its performance is far from optimal w.r.t ranking-oriented recommendation metrics. Finally, the regularization coefficients are sensitive w.r.t recommendation accuracy and vary a lot across different datasets, so the fine-tuning of these parameters is important yet time-consuming. To improve training and inference efficiency, we propose a Similarity-Structure Aware Shallow Autoencoder on top of three similarity structures, including Co-Occurrence, KNN and NSW. We then optimize the model with a weighted square loss, which is proven effective for ranking-based recommendation but still capable of deriving closed-form solutions. However, the weight in the loss can not be learned in the training set and is similarly sensitive w.r.t the accuracy to regularization coefficients. To automatically tune the hyperparameters, we design two validation losses on the validation set for guidance, and update the hyperparameters with the gradient of the validation losses. We finally evaluate the proposed method on multiple real-world datasets and show that it outperforms seven competing baselines remarkably, and verify the effectiveness of each part in the proposed method."

While maintaining high competence in user modeling and next-item recommendation, these models have long been plagued by the numerous parameters and computation, which inhibit them to be deployed on resource-constrained mobile devices. Model quantization, as one of the main paradigms for compression techniques, converts float parameters to low-bit values to reduce parameter redundancy and accelerate inference. To avoid drastic performance degradation, it usually requests a fine-tuning phase with an original dataset. However, the training set of user-item interactions is not always available due to transmission limits or privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to quantize sequential recommenders without access to any real private data. A generator is employed in the framework to synthesize fake sequence samples to feed the quantized sequential recommendation model and minimize the gap with a full-precision sequential recommendation model. The generator and the quantized model are optimized with a min-max game — alternating discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer. Moreover, we devise a two-level discrepancy modeling strategy to transfer information between the quantized model and the full-precision model.

In FedRecs, users’ attribute information and behavior data (i.e., user-item interaction data) are kept locally on their personal devices, therefore, it is considered a fairly secure approach to protect user privacy. As a result, the privacy issue of FedRecs is rarely explored. Unfortunately, several recent studies reveal that FedRecs are vulnerable to user attribute inference attacks, highlighting the privacy concerns of FedRecs. In this paper, we further investigate the privacy problem of user behavior data (i.e., user-item interactions) in FedRecs. Specifically, we perform the first systematic study on interaction-level membership inference attacks on FedRecs. An interaction-level membership inference attacker is first designed, and then the classical privacy protection mechanism, Local Differential Privacy (LDP), is adopted to defend against the membership inference attack. Unfortunately, the empirical analysis shows that LDP is not effective against such new attacks unless the recommendation performance is largely compromised. To mitigate the interaction-level membership attack threats, we design a simple yet effective defense method to significantly reduce the attacker’s inference accuracy without losing recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted with two widely used FedRecs (Fed-NCF and Fed-LightGCN) on three real-world recommendation datasets (MovieLens-100K, Steam-200K, and Amazon Cell Phone), and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our solutions."

In this paper, we propose a new Debiased Contrastive learning paradigm for Recommendation (DCRec) that unifies sequential pattern encoding with global collaborative relation modeling through adaptive conformity-aware augmentation. This solution is designed to tackle the popularity bias issue in recommendation systems. Our debiased contrastive learning framework effectively captures both the patterns of item transitions within sequences and the dependencies between users across sequences. Our experiments on various real-world datasets have demonstrated that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, indicating its efficacy for recommendation. To facilitate reproducibility of our results, we make our implementation of DCRec publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/DCRec."

A standard method learns a unique embedding vector for each user and item. However, such a method has two important limitations in real-world applications: 1) it is hard to learn embeddings that generalize well for users and items with rare interactions; and 2) it may incur unbearably high memory costs when the number of users and items scales up. Existing approaches either can only address one of the limitations or have flawed overall performances. In this paper, we propose Clustered Embedding Learning (CEL) as an integrated solution to these two problems. CEL is a plug-and-play embedding learning framework that can be combined with any differentiable feature interaction model. It is capable of achieving improved performance, especially for cold users and items, with reduced memory cost. CEL enables automatic and dynamic clustering of users and items in a top-down fashion, where clustered entities jointly learn a shared embedding. The accelerated version of CEL has an optimal time complexity, which supports efficient online updates. Theoretically, we prove the identifiability and the existence of a unique optimal number of clusters for CEL in the context of nonnegative matrix factorization. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of CEL on three public datasets and one business dataset, showing its consistently superior performance against current state-of-the-art methods. In particular, when incorporating CEL into the business model, it brings an improvement of in AUC, which translates into a significant revenue gain; meanwhile, the size of the embedding table gets 2650 times smaller.1"

By normalizing user/item embeddings to a specific value, we empirically observe impressive performance gains (9% on average) on four real-world datasets. Although encouraging, we also reveal a serious limitation when applying normalization in recommendation — the performance is highly sensitive to the choice of the temperature τ which controls the scale of the normalized embeddings."

However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent capability of improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations.

Although it has facilitated extensive physical scenarios, sequential recommendation for multi-modal sequences has long been neglected. Multi-modal data that depicts a user’s historical interactions exists ubiquitously, such as product pictures, textual descriptions, and interacted item sequences, providing semantic information from multiple perspectives that comprehensively describe a user’s preferences. However, existing sequential recommendation methods either fail to directly handle multi-modality or suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Layer Perceptron (MMMLP) for maintaining multi-modal sequences for sequential recommendation. MMMLP is a purely MLP-based architecture that consists of three modules - the Feature Mixer Layer, Fusion Mixer Layer, and Prediction Layer - and has an edge on both efficacy and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that MMMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity. We also conduct ablating analysis to verify the contribution of each component. Furthermore, compatible experiments are devised, and the results show that the multi-modal representation learned by our proposed model generally benefits other recommendation models, emphasizing our model’s ability to handle multi-modal information.

An assistive counseling conversation commences with natural open-ended topics to familiarize the client with the environment and later converges into more fine-grained domain-specific topics. Unlike other conversational systems, which are categorized as open-domain or task-oriented systems, VMHAs possess a hybrid conversational flow. These counseling bots need to comprehend various aspects of the conversation, such as dialogue-acts, intents, etc., to engage the client in an effective and appropriate conversation. Although the surge in digital health research highlights applications of many general-purpose response generation systems, they are barely suitable in the mental health domain – the prime reason is the lack of understanding in the mental health counseling conversation. Moreover, in general, dialogue-act guided response generators are either limited to a template-based paradigm or lack appropriate semantics in dialogue generation. To this end, we propose READER – a REsponse-Act guided reinforced Dialogue genERation model for the mental health counseling conversations. READER is built on transformer to jointly predict a potential dialogue-act dt + 1 for the next utterance (aka response-act) and to generate an appropriate response (ut + 1). Through the transformer-reinforcement-learning (TRL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we guide the response generator to abide by dt + 1 and ensure the semantic richness of the responses via BERTScore in our reward computation. We evaluate READER on HOPE, a benchmark counseling conversation dataset and observe that it outperforms several baselines across several evaluation metrics – METEOR, ROUGE, and BERTScore."

However, the performance of these solutions is limited by the amount of records available from warm users to use. Thus, building a recommendation system based on few interaction records from a few users still remains a challenging problem for unpopular or early-stage recommendation platforms. This paper focuses on solving the few-shot recommendation problem for news recommendation based on two observations. First, news at different platforms (even in different languages) may share similar topics. Second, the user preference over these topics is transferable across different platforms. Therefore, we propose to solve the few-shot news recommendation problem by transferring the user-news preference from a many-shot source domain to a few-shot target domain. To bridge two domains that are even in different languages and without any overlapping users and news, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-lingual transfer model as the news encoder that aligns semantically similar news in two domains. A user encoder is constructed on top of the aligned news encoding and transfers the user preference from the source to target domain. Experimental results on two real-world news recommendation datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method on addressing few-shot news recommendation, comparing to the baselines.

However, training the RL policy from scratch without hurting users’ experience is unavoidable due to the requirement of trial-and-error searches. Furthermore, the offline methods, which aim to optimize the policy without online interactions, suffer from the notorious stability problem in value estimation or unbounded variance in counterfactual policy evaluation. To this end, we propose optimizing user retention with Decision Transformer (DT), which avoids the offline difficulty by translating the RL as an autoregressive problem. However, deploying the DT in recommendation is a non-trivial problem because of the following challenges: (1) deficiency in modeling the numerical reward value; (2) data discrepancy between the policy learning and recommendation generation; (3) unreliable offline performance evaluation. In this work, we, therefore, contribute a series of strategies for tackling the exposed issues. We first articulate an efficient reward prompt by weighted aggregation of meta embeddings for informative reward embedding. Then, we endow a weighted contrastive learning method to solve the discrepancy between training and inference. Furthermore, we design two robust offline metrics to measure user retention. Finally, the significant improvement in the benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/kesenzhao/DT4Rec.git."

We introduce two critical techniques. Firstly, we develop an adaptive and scalable sampler based on the retriever, to generate hard negative samples for the ranker’s training. Compared with the widely-used exact top-k sampling, our method effectively alleviates the issues of false negative and item distribution shift, and thus improves the ranker’s discriminability. Secondly, we propose a novel asymptotic-unbiased estimation of KL divergence, which serves as the objective for knowledge distillation. The new objective can be efficiently optimized with commonly-used optimizers. More importantly, it leads to better alignment of ranking order between retriever and ranker, which helps to improve the retrieval quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments over four large-scale datasets, where CoRR outperforms both conventional DRS and the existing joint training methods with notable advantages.

The basic idea is to employ pre-trained language models (PLM) to encode item text into item representations. Despite the promising transferability, the binding between item text and item representations might be too tight, leading to potential problems such as over-emphasizing the effect of text features and exaggerating the negative impact of domain gap. To address this issue, this paper proposes VQ-Rec, a novel approach to learning Vector-Quantized item representations for transferable sequential Recommenders. The main novelty of our approach lies in the new item representation scheme: it first maps item text into a vector of discrete indices (called item code), and then employs these indices to lookup the code embedding table for deriving item representations. Such a scheme can be denoted as “text ⟹ code ⟹ representation”. Based on this representation scheme, we further propose an enhanced contrastive pre-training approach, using semi-synthetic and mixed-domain code representations as hard negatives. Furthermore, we design a new cross-domain fine-tuning method based on a differentiable permutation-based network. Extensive experiments conducted on six public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in both cross-domain and cross-platform settings.

Existing fashion recommender systems (FRSs) typically focus on clothing item suggestions for users in three scenarios: 1) how to best recommend fashion items preferred by users; 2) how to best compose a complete outfit, and 3) how to best complete a clothing ensemble. However, current FRSs often overlook an important aspect when making FR, that is, the compatibility of the clothing item or outfit recommendations is highly dependent on the scene context. To this end, we propose the scene-aware fashion recommender system (SAFRS), which uncovers a hitherto unexplored avenue where scene information is taken into account when constructing the FR model. More specifically, our SAFRS addresses this problem by encoding scene and outfit information in separation attention encoders and then fusing the resulting feature embeddings via a novel scene-aware compatibility score function. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to show that our SAFRS model outperforms all baselines for every evaluated metric."

Multi-behaviors are often taken in certain orders in real-world applications (e.g., click>cart>buy). In a behavior chain, a latter behavior usually exhibits a stronger signal of user preference than the former one does. Most existing multi-behavior models fail to capture such dependencies in a behavior chain for embedding learning. In this work, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommendation model with cascading graph convolution networks (named MB-CGCN). In MB-CGCN, the embeddings learned from one behavior are used as the input features for the next behavior’s embedding learning after a feature transformation operation. In this way, our model explicitly utilizes the behavior dependencies in embedding learning. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on exploiting multi-behavior data. It outperforms the best baseline by 33.7% and 35.9% on average over the two datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10, respectively."

Existing approaches usually set pre-defined short-term interest length by exhaustive search or empirical experience, which is either highly inefficient or yields subpar results. The recent advanced transformer-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performances despite the aforementioned issue, but they have a quadratic computational complexity to the length of the input sequence. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming for better modeling users’ long/short-term interests from their historical interactions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm for preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization.

To overcome the data multi-modality and architecture heterogeneity challenges in the recommendation domain, NASRec establishes a large supernet (i.e., search space) to search the full architectures. The supernet incorporates versatile choice of operators and dense connectivity to minimize human efforts for finding priors. The scale and heterogeneity in NASRec impose several challenges, such as training inefficiency, operator-imbalance, and degraded rank correlation. We tackle these challenges by proposing single-operator any-connection sampling, operator-balancing interaction modules, and post-training fine-tuning.

The previous frameworks are invalid against inductive recommendations, such as sequential recommendations, since the disparities of difference vectors constructed by the recommendations between members and non-members become imperceptible.

Specifically, we train a surrogate model to simulate the target model based on two universal loss functions. For a given behavior sequence, the loss functions ensure the recommended items and corresponding rank of the surrogate model are consistent with the target model’s recommendation. Due to the special training mode of the surrogate model, it is hard to judge which user is its member(non-member). Therefore, we establish a shadow model and use shadow model’s members(non-members) to train the attack model later. Next, we build a user feature generator to construct representative feature vectors from the shadow(surrogate) model. The crafting feature vectors are finally input into the attack model to identify users’ membership. Furthermore, to tackle the high cost of obtaining in-distribution data, we develop two variants of ME-MIA, realizing data-efficient and even data-free MIA by fabricating authentic in-distribution data. Notably, the latter is impossible in the previous works. Finally, we evaluate ME-MIA against multiple sequential recommendation models on three real-world datasets. Experimental results show that ME-MIA and its variants can achieve efficient extraction and outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of attack performance."

With the presence of rising granularity of consumer data, many industries started exploring larger action candidate spaces to support more precise personalized action. While inverse propensity score (IPS) is a standard OPE estimator, it suffers from more severe variance issues with increasing action spaces. To address this issue, we theoretically prove that the estimation variance can be reduced by merging actions into groups while the distinction among these action effects on the outcome can induce extra bias. Motivated by these, we propose a novel IPS estimator with outcome-oriented action Grouping (GroupIPS), which leverages a Lipschitz regularized network to measure the distance of action effects in the embedding space and merges nearest action neighbors. This strategy enables more robust estimation by achieving smaller variances while inducing minor additional bias. Empirically, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

Unfortunately, most leading popularity debiasing strategies, rather than tackling the vulnerability of CF models to varying popularity distributions, require prior knowledge of the test distribution to identify the degree of bias and further learn the popularity-entangled representations to mitigate the bias. Consequently, these models result in significant performance benefits in the target test set, while dramatically deviating the recommendation from users’ true interests without knowing the popularity distribution in advance. In this work, we propose a novel learning framework, Invariant Collaborative Filtering (InvCF), to discover disentangled representations that faithfully reveal the latent preference and popularity semantics without making any assumption about the popularity distribution. At its core is the distillation of unbiased preference representations (i.e., user preference on item property), which are invariant to the change of popularity semantics, while filtering out the popularity feature that is unstable or outdated. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and four evaluation settings (i.e., synthetic long-tail, unbiased, temporal split, and out-of-distribution evaluations) demonstrate that InvCF outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of popularity generalization ability on real recommendations. Visualization studies shed light on the advantages of InvCF for disentangled representation learning. Our codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/InvCF."

Most of the existing works on sequential recommendation model users’ dynamic interest in specific items while overlooking users’ static interest revealed by some static attribute information of items, e.g., category, brand. Moreover, existing works often only consider the positive excitation of a user’s historical interactions on his/her next choice on candidate items while ignoring the commonly existing negative excitation, resulting in insufficiently modeling dynamic interest. The overlook of static interest and negative excitation will lead to incomplete interest modeling and thus impedes the recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose modeling both static interest and negative excitation for dynamic interest to further improve the recommendation performance. Accordingly, we design a novel Static-Dynamic Interest Learning (SDIL) framework featured with a novel Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation Modeling (TPNE) module for accurate sequential recommendation. TPNE is specially designed for comprehensively modeling dynamic interest based on temporal positive and negative excitation learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SDIL can effectively capture both static and dynamic interest and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."

To this end, we propose a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative filtering. Firstly, we design the personalized graph signal containing richer user information and construct an augmented similarity graph containing more graph topology information, to more effectively characterize user interests. Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful information in the high-frequency components of the observed signals by combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the personalized graph signal, the augmented similarity graph and the mixed-frequency graph filter by proposing a pipeline consisting of three key steps: pre-processing, graph convolution and post-processing. Extensive experiments show that PGSP can achieve superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art CF methods and, as a nonparametric method, PGSP has very high training efficiency."

However, current MTL-based recommendation models tend to disregard the session-wise patterns of user-item interactions because they are predominantly constructed based on item-wise datasets. Moreover, balancing multiple objectives has always been a challenge in this field, which is typically avoided via linear estimations in existing works. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enhanced MTL framework, namely RMTL, to combine the losses of different recommendation tasks using dynamic weights. To be specific, the RMTL structure can address the two aforementioned issues by (i) constructing an MTL environment from session-wise interactions and (ii) training multi-task actor-critic network structure, which is compatible with most existing MTL-based recommendation models, and (iii) optimizing and fine-tuning the MTL loss function using the weights generated by critic networks. Experiments on two real-world public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RMTL with a higher AUC against state-of-the-art MTL-based recommendation models. Additionally, we evaluate and validate RMTL’s compatibility and transferability across various MTL models."

We integrate the corrector with the recommender by sharing the encoder and by training them jointly.

However, existing CDR methods mostly focus on designing effective model architectures to transfer the source domain knowledge, ignoring the behavior-level effect during the loss optimization process, where behaviors regarding different aspects in the source domain may have different importance for the CDR model optimization. The ignorance of the behavior-level effect will cause the carefully designed model architectures ending up with sub-optimal parameters, which limits the recommendation performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a generic behavioral importance-aware optimization framework for cross-domain recommendation (BIAO). Specifically, we propose a behavioral perceptron which predicts the importance of each source behavior according to the corresponding item’s global impact and local user-specific impact. The joint optimization process of the CDR model and the behavioral perceptron is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the lower optimization, only the CDR model is updated with weighted source behavior loss and the target domain loss, while in the upper optimization, the behavioral perceptron is updated with implicit gradient from a developing dataset obtained through the proposed reorder-and-reuse strategy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed optimization framework consistently improves the performance of different cross-domain recommendation models in 7 cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating that our method can serve as a generic and powerful tool for cross-domain recommendation1."

In contrast, unbiased ratings obtained from randomized controlled trials or A/B tests are considered to be the golden standard, but are costly and small in scale in reality. To exploit both types of data, recent works proposed to use unbiased ratings to correct the parameters of the propensity or imputation models trained on the biased dataset. However, the existing methods fail to obtain accurate predictions in the presence of unobserved confounding or model misspecification. In this paper, we propose a theoretically guaranteed model-agnostic balancing approach that can be applied to any existing debiasing method with the aim of combating unobserved confounding and model misspecification. The proposed approach makes full use of unbiased data by alternatively correcting model parameters learned with biased data, and adaptively learning balance coefficients of biased samples for further debiasing. Extensive real-world experiments are conducted along with the deployment of our proposal on four representative debiasing methods to demonstrate the effectiveness."

The state-of-the-art detection models are siloed and have largely overlooked a variety of data characteristics from multiple cross-lingual platforms.

In this paper, we propose FedACK, a new federated adversarial contrastive knowledge distillation framework for social bot detection. We devise a GAN-based federated knowledge distillation mechanism for efficiently transferring knowledge of data distribution among clients. In particular, a global generator is used to extract the knowledge of global data distribution and distill it into each client’s local model. We leverage local discriminator to enable customized model design and use local generator for data enhancement with hard-to-decide samples. Local training is conducted as multi-stage adversarial and contrastive learning to enable consistent feature spaces among clients and to constrain the optimization direction of local models, reducing the divergences between local and global models. Experiments demonstrate that FedACK outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, and feature space consistency."

Our paper focuses on representativeness, one of six proposed metrics that form our methodology, to address the limitations we have identified with the W3C Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM). These include the evaluative scope, the non-probabilistic sampling approach, and the potential for bias within the selected sample. Representativeness, in particular, is a metric to assess the quality and coverage of sampling. To measure this, we systematically evaluate five web page representations with a website of 388 pages, including tags, structure, the DOM tree, content, and a mixture of structure and content. Our findings highlight the importance of including structural components in representations. We validate our conclusions using the same methodology for three additional random sites of 500 pages.

We add to the body of literature by presenting a model that employs a multi-head attention mechanism on deep contextual features of the target word and candidate glosses to refine the target word embedding. Furthermore, to encourage the model to learn the relevant part of target features that align with the correct gloss, we recursively alternate attention on target word features and that of candidate glosses to gradually extract the relevant contextual features of the target word, refining its representation and strengthening the final disambiguation results.

In this paper, we find that providing hashtags to social media tweets can help alleviate this issue because hashtags can enrich short and ambiguous tweets in terms of various information, such as topic, sentiment, and stance. This motivates us to propose a novel Hashtag-guided Tweet Classification model (HashTation), which automatically generates meaningful hashtags for the input tweet to provide useful auxiliary signals for tweet classification. To generate high-quality and insightful hashtags, our hashtag generation model retrieves and encodes the post-level and entity-level information across the whole corpus. Experiments show that HashTation achieves significant improvements on seven low-resource tweet classification tasks, in which only a limited amount of training data is provided, showing that automatically enriching tweets with model-generated hashtags could significantly reduce the demand for large-scale human-labeled data. Further analysis demonstrates that HashTation is able to generate high-quality hashtags that are consistent with the tweets and their labels.

However, these methods only calculate similarities between candidate summaries and the entire document embeddings, insufficiently capturing interactions between different contextual information in the document to accurately estimate the importance of candidates. In this paper, we propose a new hyperbolic interaction model for extractive multi-document summarization (HISum). Specifically, HISum first learns document and candidate summary representations in the same hyperbolic space to capture latent hierarchical structures and then estimates the importance scores of candidates by jointly modeling interactions between each candidate and the document from global and local views. Finally, the importance scores are used to rank and extract the best candidate as the extracted summary. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that HISum outperforms the state-of-the-art extractive baselines1."

Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence due to the nature of convolution operations. Recent advancements have shown the potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant and quadratic time complexity, with transformers directly applicable to the MTSC task because of the distinct properties of time series data. To tackle these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed. To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and (3) tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly available datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the FormerTime compared to previous competitive baselines."

In order to facilitate navigating, searching, and maintaining its content, Wikipedia’s guidelines state that all articles should be annotated with a so-called short description indicating the article’s topic (e.g., the short description of beer is “Alcoholic drink made from fermented cereal grains”). Nonetheless, a large fraction of articles (ranging from 10.2% in Dutch to 99.7% in Kazakh) have no short description yet, with detrimental effects for millions of Wikipedia users. Motivated by this problem, we introduce the novel task of automatically generating short descriptions for Wikipedia articles and propose Descartes, a multilingual model for tackling it. Descartes integrates three sources of information to generate an article description in a target language: the text of the article in all its language versions, the already-existing descriptions (if any) of the article in other languages, and semantic type information obtained from a knowledge graph. We evaluate a Descartes model trained for handling 25 languages simultaneously, showing that it beats baselines (including a strong translation-based baseline) and performs on par with monolingual models tailored for specific languages. A human evaluation on three languages further shows that the quality of Descartes’s descriptions is largely indistinguishable from that of human-written descriptions; e.g., 91.3% of our English descriptions (vs. 92.1% of human-written descriptions) pass the bar for inclusion in Wikipedia, suggesting that Descartes is ready for production, with the potential to support human editors in filling a major gap in today’s Wikipedia across languages."

However, conventional recommendation models solely conduct a one-time training-test fashion and can hardly adapt to evolving demands, considering user preference shifts and ever-increasing users and items in the real world. To tackle such challenges, the streaming recommendation is proposed and has attracted great attention recently. Among these, continual graph learning is widely regarded as a promising approach for the streaming recommendation by academia and industry. However, existing methods either rely on the historical data replay which is often not practical under increasingly strict data regulations, or can seldom solve the over-stability issue. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel Dynamically Expandable Graph Convolution (DEGC) algorithm from a model isolation perspective for the streaming recommendation which is orthogonal to previous methods. Based on the motivation of disentangling outdated short-term preferences from useful long-term preferences, we design a sequence of operations including graph convolution pruning, refining, and expanding to only preserve beneficial long-term preference-related parameters and extract fresh short-term preferences. Moreover, we model the temporal user preference, which is utilized as user embedding initialization, for better capturing the individual-level preference shifts. Extensive experiments on the three most representative GCN-based recommendation models and four industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method."

In this paper, we focus on improving DST module to generate dialogue states in circumstances with limited annotations and knowledge about slot ontology. To this end, we design a dual prompt learning framework for few-shot DST. The dual framework aims to explore how to utilize the language understanding and generation capabilities of pre-trained language models for DST efficiently. Specifically, we consider the learning of slot generation and value generation as dual tasks, and two kinds of prompts are designed based on this dual structure to incorporate task-related knowledge of these two tasks respectively. In this way, the DST task can be formulated as a language modeling task efficiently under few-shot settings. To evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on two task-oriented dialogue datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot methods, but also can generate unseen slots.

However, due to the heterogeneous nature of users and items, developing an effective aggregation strategy that works across multiple GNN-Rs, such as LightGCN and KGAT, remains a challenge.

Existing works are limited to supervised approaches relying on abundant labeled data, but in the open and dynamic environment of Internet, involving constant semantic change of known topics and the appearance of unknown topics, text annotations are hard to access in time for each period. That calls for the technique of weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), which requires just seed words for each category and has succeed in static text classification tasks. However, there are still no studies of applying WSTC methods in a continual learning paradigm to actually accommodate the open and evolving Internet. In this paper, we tackle this problem for the first time and propose a framework, named Continual Learning for Weakly Supervised Text Classification (CL-WSTC), which can take any WSTC method as base model. It consists of two modules, classification decision with delay and seed word updating. In the former, the probability threshold for each category in each period is adaptively learned to determine the acceptance/rejection of texts. In the latter, with candidate words output by the base model, seed words are added and deleted via reinforcement learning with immediate rewards, according to an empirically certified unsupervised measure. Extensive experiments show that our approach has strong universality and can achieve a better trade-off between classification accuracy and decision timeliness compared to non-continual counterparts, with intuitively interpretable updating of seed words."

Specifically, we first augment the training set by extracting diversified targets that are unseen during training with a keyphrase generation model. Then, we develop a teacher-student framework which effectively utilizes the augmented data. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ZSSD baselines on the available benchmark dataset for this task by 8.9% in macro-averaged F1. In addition, previous ZSSD requires human-annotated targets and labels during training, which may not be available in real-world applications. Therefore, we go one step further by proposing a more challenging open-world ZSSD task: identifying the stance of a text towards an unseen target without human-annotated targets and stance labels. We show that our TTS can be easily adapted to the new task. Remarkably, TTS without human-annotated targets and stance labels even significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art ZSSD baselines trained with human-annotated data.

The general approach to this task is to naturally train the representation model on training data without intervention. However, such natural training scheme is prone to modality bias of representation (i.e., tending to over-encode some informative modalities while neglecting other modalities) and data bias of training (i.e., tending to overfit training data). These biases may lead to instability (e.g., performing poorly when the neglected modality is dominant for recognition) and weak generalization (e.g., performing poorly when unseen data is inconsistent with overfitted data) of the model on unseen data. To address these problems, this paper presents two adversarial training strategies to learn more robust multi-modal representation for multi-label emotion recognition. Firstly, we propose an adversarial temporal masking strategy, which can enhance the encoding of other modalities by masking the most emotion-related temporal units (e.g., words for text or frames for video) of the informative modality. Secondly, we propose an adversarial parameter perturbation strategy, which can enhance the generalization of the model by adding the adversarial perturbation to the parameters of model. Both strategies boost model performance on the benchmark MMER datasets CMU-MOSEI and NEMu. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the previous state-of-the-art method. Code will be released at https://github.com/ShipingGe/MMER."

An eligible continual few-shot learning model is expected to distinguish all seen classes upon new categories arriving, where each category only includes very few labeled data. However, existing continual few-shot learning methods only consider the visual modality, where the distributions of new categories often indistinguishably overlap with old categories, thus resulting in the severe catastrophic forgetting problem. To tackle this problem, in this paper we study continual few-shot learning with the assistance of semantic knowledge by simultaneously taking both visual modality and semantic concepts of categories into account. We propose a Continual few-shot learning algorithm with Semantic knowledge Regularization (CoSR) for adapting to the distribution changes of visual prototypes through a Transformer-based prototype adaptation mechanism. Specifically, the original visual prototypes from the backbone are fed into the well-designed Transformer with corresponding semantic concepts, where the semantic concepts are extracted from all categories. The semantic-level regularization forces the categories with similar semantics to be closely distributed, while the opposite ones are constrained to be far away from each other. The semantic regularization improves the model’s ability to distinguish between new and old categories, thus significantly mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in continual few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, miniImageNet, CUB200 and an industrial dataset with long-tail distribution demonstrate the advantages of our CoSR model compared with state-of-the-art methods."

Considering the ground truth Y to be a signal on graph, the smoothness index is equivalent to the value of the heterophily ratio. From this perspective, we aim to address the heterophily problem in the spectral domain. First, we point out that heterophily is positively associated with the frequency of a graph. Towards this end, we could prune inter-class edges by simply emphasizing and delineating the high-frequency components of the graph. Recall that graph Laplacian is a high-pass filter, we adopt it to measure the extent of 1-hop label changing of the center node and indicate high-frequency components. As GAD can be formulated as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, only part of the nodes are labeled. As an alternative, we use the prediction of the nodes to estimate it. Through our analysis, we show that prediction errors are less likely to affect the identification process. Extensive empirical evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the indicator over popular homophilic, heterophilic, and tailored fraud detection methods. Our proposed indicator can effectively reduce the heterophily degree of the graph, thus boosting the overall GAD performance. Codes are open-sourced in https://github.com/blacksingular/GHRN."

In this paper, we present a new framework CTRLStruct for dialogue structure learning to effectively explore topic-level dialogue clusters as well as their transitions with unlabelled information. Precisely, dialogue utterances encoded by bi-directional Transformer are further trained through a special designed contrastive learning task to improve representation. Then we perform clustering to utterance-level representations and form topic-level clusters that can be considered as vertices in dialogue structure graph. The edges in the graph indicating transition probability between vertices are calculated by mimicking expert behavior in datasets. Finally, dialogue structure graph is integrated into dialogue model to perform controlled response generation. Experiments on two popular open-domain dialogue datasets show our model can generate more coherent responses compared to some excellent dialogue models, as well as outperform some typical sentence embedding methods in dialogue utterance representation.

However, long-term QPS prediction is challenging in two aspects: 1) generality across various services with different temporal patterns, 2) characterization of intricate QPS sequences which are entangled by multiple components. In this paper, we propose a knowledge auto-embedding Informer network (KAE-Informer) for forecasting the long-term QPS sequences of microservices. By analyzing a large number of microservice traces, we discover that there are two main decomposable and predictable components in QPS sequences, namely global trend & dominant periodicity (TP) and low-frequency residual patterns with long-range dependencies. These two components are important for accurately forecasting long-term QPS. First, KAE-Informer embeds the knowledge of TP components through mathematical modeling. Second, KAE-Informer designs a convolution ProbSparse self-attention mechanism and a multi-layer event discrimination scheme to extract and embed the knowledge of local context awareness and event regression effect implied in residual components, respectively. We conduct experiments based on three real datasets including a QPS dataset collected from 40 microservices. The experiment results show that KAE-Informer achieves a reduction of MAPE, MAE and RMSE by about 16.6%, 17.6% and 23.1% respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art models."

The key to social event classification is effectively leveraging the visual and textual semantics for classification. However, most of the existing approaches may suffer from the following limitations: (1) Most of them just simply concatenate the image features and text features to get the multimodal features and ignore the fine-grained semantic relationship between modalities. (2) The majority of them hold the closed-world assumption that all classes in test are already seen in training, while this assumption can be easily broken in real-world applications. In practice, new events on Internet may not belong to any existing/seen class, and therefore cannot be correctly identified by closed-world learning algorithms. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Open-World Social Event Classifier (OWSEC) model in this paper. Firstly, we design a multimodal mask transformer network to capture cross-modal semantic relations and fuse fine-grained multimodal features of social events while masking redundant information. Secondly, we design an open-world classifier and propose a cross-modal event mixture mechanism with a novel open-world classification loss to capture the potential distribution space of the unseen class. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed OWSEC model for open-world social event classification."

The previous works for the political stance problem focus on (1) identifying political factors that could reflect the political stance of a news article and (2) capturing those factors effectively. Despite their empirical successes, they are not sufficiently justified in terms of how effective their identified factors are in the political stance prediction. Motivated by this, in this work, we conduct a user study to investigate important factors in political stance prediction, and observe that the context and tone of a news article (implicit) and external knowledge for real-world entities appearing in the article (explicit) are important in determining its political stance. Based on this observation, we propose a novel knowledge-aware approach to political stance prediction (KHAN), employing (1) hierarchical attention networks (HAN) to learn the relationships among words and sentences in three different levels and (2) knowledge encoding (KE) to incorporate external knowledge for real-world entities into the process of political stance prediction. Also, to take into account the subtle and important difference between opposite political stances, we build two independent political knowledge graphs (KG) (i.e., KG-lib and KG-con) by ourselves and learn to fuse the different political knowledge. Through extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of KHAN in terms of (1) accuracy, (2) efficiency, and (3) effectiveness."

We propose a novel method to extract such relation information from (dis)agreement data into an inductive social relation graph, merely using the comment-reply pairs without any additional platform-specific information. The inductive social relation globally considers the historical discussion and the relation between authors. Textual information based on a pre-trained language model and social relation information encoded by pre-trained RGCN are jointly considered for (dis)agreement detection. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for both the in-domain and cross-domain tasks on the benchmark – DEBAGREEMENT. We find social relations can boost the performance of the (dis)agreement detection model, especially for the long-token comment-reply pairs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the social relation graph. We also explore the effect of the knowledge graph embedding methods, the information fusing method, and the time interval in constructing the social relation graph, which shows the effectiveness of our model."

Recent work focus on cross-domain OTE, which is typically encountered in real-world scenarios, where the testing and training distributions differ. Most methods use domain adversarial neural networks that aim to reduce the domain gap between the labelled source and unlabelled target domains to improve target domain performance. However, this approach only aligns feature distributions and does not account for class-wise feature alignment, leading to suboptimal results. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been explored as a solution, but is limited by the quality of pseudo-labels generated by the model. Inspired by the theoretical foundations in domain adaptation [2], we propose a new SSL approach that opts for selecting target samples whose model output from a domain-specific teacher and student network disagree on the unlabelled target data, in an effort to boost the target domain performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark cross-domain OTE datasets show that this approach is effective and performs consistently well in settings with large domain shifts."

For the first time, Dynalogue provides a promising solution to mitigate the need for cyber professionals via automatically generating problem-targeted conversions to victims of cyber attacks. In spite of many dialogue systems developed in the past, Dynalogue provides a distinct capability of handling long and complicated sentences that are common in cybersecurity-related conversations. It is challenging to have this capability because limited memory in dialogue systems can be hard to accommodate sufficient key information of long sentences. To overcome this challenge, Dynalogue utilises an attention mechanism that dynamically captures key semantics within a sentence instead of using fix window to cut off the sentence. To evaluate Dynalogue, we collect 67K real-world conversations (0.6M utterances) from Bleeping Computer2, which is one of the most popular cybersecurity consultancy websites in the world. The results suggest that Dynalogue outperforms all the existing dialogue systems with 1% ∼ 9% improvements on all different metrics. We further run Dynalogue on the public dataset WikiHow to validate its compatibility in other domains where conversations are also long and complicated. Dynalogue also outperforms all the other methods with at most 2.4% improvement."

Pool-based active learning first builds a pool of unlabelled data and iteratively selects data to be labeled so that the total number of required labels is minimized, keeping the model performance high. Many effective criteria for choosing data from the pool have been proposed in the literature. However, how to build the pool is less explored. Specifically, most of the methods assume that a task-specific pool is given for free. In this paper, we advocate that such a task-specific pool is not always available and propose the use of a myriad of unlabelled data on the Web for the pool for which active learning is applied. As the pool is extremely large, it is likely that relevant data exist in the pool for many tasks, and we do not need to explicitly design and build the pool for each task. The challenge is that we cannot compute the acquisition scores of all data exhaustively due to the size of the pool. We propose an efficient method, Seafaring, to retrieve informative data in terms of active learning from the Web using a user-side information retrieval algorithm. In the experiments, we use the online Flickr environment as the pool for active learning. This pool contains more than ten billion images and is several orders of magnitude larger than the existing pools in the literature for active learning. We confirm that our method performs better than existing approaches of using a small unlabelled pool."

Scientific literature tagging is beyond a pure multi-label text classification task because papers on the Web are prevalently accompanied by metadata information such as venues, authors, and references, which may serve as additional signals to infer relevant tags. Although there have been studies making use of metadata in academic paper classification, their focus is often restricted to one or two scientific fields (e.g., computer science and biomedicine) and to one specific model. In this work, we systematically study the effect of metadata on scientific literature tagging across 19 fields. We select three representative multi-label classifiers (i.e., a bag-of-words model, a sequence-based model, and a pre-trained language model) and explore their performance change in scientific literature tagging when metadata are fed to the classifiers as additional features. We observe some ubiquitous patterns of metadata’s effects across all fields (e.g., venues are consistently beneficial to paper tagging in almost all cases), as well as some unique patterns in fields other than computer science and biomedicine, which are not explored in previous studies."

With the rapid development of online platforms for generating and distributing text-rich documents, there arises an urgent need for continuously summarizing dynamically evolving multi-document sets where the composition of documents and sets is changing over time. This is especially challenging as the summarization should be not only effective in incorporating relevant, novel, and distinctive information from each concurrent multi-document set, but also efficient in serving online applications. In this work, we propose a new summarization problem, Evolving Multi-Document sets stream Summarization (EMDS), and introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm PDSum with the idea of prototype-driven continuous summarization. PDSum builds a lightweight prototype of each multi-document set and exploits it to adapt to new documents while preserving accumulated knowledge from previous documents. To update new summaries, the most representative sentences for each multi-document set are extracted by measuring their similarities to the prototypes. A thorough evaluation with real multi-document sets streams demonstrates that PDSum outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised multi-document summarization algorithms in EMDS in terms of relevance, novelty, and distinctiveness and is also robust to various evaluation settings."

With the growing need for news headline generation, we argue that the hallucination issue, namely the generated headlines being not supported by the original news stories, is a critical challenge for the deployment of this feature in web-scale systems Meanwhile, due to the infrequency of hallucination cases and the requirement of careful reading for raters to reach the correct consensus, it is difficult to acquire a large dataset for training a model to detect such hallucinations through human curation. In this work, we present a new framework named ExHalder to address this challenge for headline hallucination detection. ExHalder adapts the knowledge from public natural language inference datasets into the news domain and learns to generate natural language sentences to explain the hallucination detection results. To evaluate the model performance, we carefully collect a dataset with more than six thousand labeled ⟨ article, headline⟩ pairs. Extensive experiments on this dataset and another six public ones demonstrate that ExHalder can identify hallucinated headlines accurately and justifies its predictions with human-readable natural language explanations."

The success of these web applications largely depends on the ability of the employed machine learning model to accurately distinguish influential features from all the predetermined features in tabular data. Intuitively, in practical business scenarios, different instances should correspond to different sets of influential features, and the set of influential features of the same instance may vary in different scenarios. However, most existing methods focus on global feature selection assuming that all instances have the same set of influential features, and few methods considering instance-wise feature selection ignore the variability of influential features in different scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce a new perspective based on the influence function for instance-wise feature selection, and give some corresponding theoretical insights, the core of which is to use the influence function as an indicator to measure the importance of an instance-wise feature. We then propose a new solution for discovering instance-wise influential features in tabular data (DIWIFT), where a self-attention network is used as a feature selection model and the value of the corresponding influence function is used as an optimization objective to guide the model. Benefiting from the advantage of the influence function, i.e., its computation does not depend on a specific architecture and can also take into account the data distribution in different scenarios, our DIWIFT has better flexibility and robustness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our DIWIFT."

Recent work has shown the effectiveness of leveraging DOM trees and pre-trained language models to describe and encode webpages. However, they typically optimize the model to learn the semantic co-occurrence of elements and labels in the same webpage, thus their effectiveness depends on sufficient labeled data, which is labor-intensive. In this paper, we further observe structural co-occurrences in different webpages of the same website: the same position in the DOM tree usually plays the same semantic role, and the DOM nodes in this position also share similar surface forms. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method, Structor, to effectively incorporate the structural co-occurrences over DOM tree and surface form into pre-trained language models. Such structural co-occurrences help the model learn the task better under low-resource settings, and we study two challenging experimental scenarios: website-level low-resource setting and webpage-level low-resource setting, to evaluate our approach. Extensive experiments on the public SWDE dataset show that Structor significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both settings, and even achieves three times the performance of the strong baseline model in the case of extreme lack of training data."

The end-to-end models have achieved satisfactory performance in summarization, but the success is built upon enough annotated data, which is costly to obtain, especially in the dialogue summarization. To leverage the rich external data, previous works first pre-train the model on the other domain data (e.g., the news domain), and then fine-tune it directly on the dialogue domain. The data from different domains are equally treated during the training process, while the vast differences between dialogues (usually informal, repetitive, and with multiple speakers) and conventional articles (usually formal and concise) are neglected. In this work, we propose to use a disentangled representation method to reduce the deviation between data in different domains, where the input data is disentangled into domain-invariant and domain-specific representations. The domain-invariant representation carries context information that is supposed to be the same across domains (e.g., news, dialogue) and the domain-specific representation indicates the input data belongs to a particular domain. We use adversarial learning and contrastive learning to constrain the disentangled representations to the target space. Furthermore, we propose two novel reconstruction strategies, namely backtracked and cross-track reconstructions, which aim to reduce the domain characteristics of out-of-domain data and mitigate the domain bias of the model. Experimental results on three public datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the strong baselines."

Hence, in this work, we propose XWikiGen, which is the task of cross-lingual multi-document summarization of text from multiple reference articles, written in various languages, to generate Wikipedia-style text. Accordingly, we contribute a benchmark dataset, XWikiRef, spanning ∼ 69K Wikipedia articles covering five domains and eight languages. We harness this dataset to train a two-stage system where the input is a set of citations and a section title and the output is a section-specific LR summary. The proposed system is based on a novel idea of neural unsupervised extractive summarization to coarsely identify salient information followed by a neural abstractive model to generate the section-specific text.

In order to build more intelligent dialogue systems, it’s important to learn how to demonstrate empathy toward others. Existing studies focus on identifying and leveraging the user’s coarse emotion to generate empathetic responses. However, human emotion and dialog act (e.g., intent) evolve as the talk goes along in an empathetic dialogue. This leads to the generated responses with very different intents from the human responses. As a result, empathy failure is ultimately caused. Therefore, using fine-grained emotion and intent sequential data on conversational emotions and dialog act is crucial for empathetic response generation. On the other hand, existing empathy models overvalue the empathy of responses while ignoring contextual relevance, which results in repetitive model-generated responses. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Factor sequence Fusion framework (EmpMFF) based on conditional variational autoencoder. To generate empathetic responses, the proposed EmpMFF encodes a combination of contextual, emotion, and intent information into a continuous latent variable, which is then fed into the decoder. Experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues benchmark dataset demonstrate that EmpMFF exhibits exceptional performance in both automatic and human evaluations."

Consequently, multiple features with high relevance may be selected simultaneously, resulting in sub-optimal result. In this work, we solve this problem by proposing an AutoML-based feature selection framework that can automatically search the optimal feature subset. Specifically, we first embed the search space into a weight-sharing Supernet. Then, a two-stage neural architecture search method is employed to evaluate the feature quality. In the first stage, a well-designed sampling method considering feature convergence fairness is applied to train the Supernet. In the second stage, a reinforcement learning method is used to search for the optimal feature subset efficiently.

Generally, healthcare consumers use long and detailed questions with several peripheral details to express their healthcare concerns, contributing to natural language understanding challenges. One way to address this challenge is by summarizing the questions. However, most of the existing abstractive summarization systems generate impeccably fluent yet factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary. Our extensive experimental results on two benchmark consumer health question summarization datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method by achieving state-of-the-art performance and generating factually correct and fluent summaries, as measured by human evaluation."

With the rapid development of deep learning, deep clustering has achieved significant advantages over traditional clustering methods. Despite the effectiveness, most existing deep text clustering methods rely heavily on representations pre-trained in general domains, which may not be the most suitable solution for clustering in specific target domains. To address this issue, we propose CEIL, a novel Classification-Enhanced Iterative Learning framework for short text clustering, which aims at generally promoting the clustering performance by introducing a classification objective to iteratively improve feature representations. In each iteration, we first adopt a language model to retrieve the initial text representations, from which the clustering results are collected using our proposed Category Disentangled Contrastive Clustering (CDCC) algorithm. After strict data filtering and aggregation processes, samples with clean category labels are retrieved, which serve as supervision information to update the language model with the classification objective via a prompt learning approach. Finally, the updated language model with improved representation ability is used to enhance clustering in the next iteration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CEIL framework significantly improves the clustering performance over iterations, and is generally effective on various clustering algorithms. Moreover, by incorporating CEIL on CDCC, we achieve the state-of-the-art clustering performance on a wide range of short text clustering benchmarks outperforming other strong baseline methods."

Can we interpret any relationships between events that determine the trends from multi-aspect perspectives? Real-world online activities can be composed of (1) many time-changing interactions that control trends, for example, competition/cooperation to gain user attention, as well as (2) seasonal patterns that covers trends. To model the shifting trends via interactions, namely dynamic interactions over tensor streams, in this paper, we propose a streaming algorithm, DISMO, that we designed to discover Dynamic Interactions and Seasonality in a Multi-Order tensor. Our approach has the following properties. (a) Interpretable: it incorporates interpretable non-linear differential equations in tensor factorization so that it can reveal latent interactive relationships and thus generate future events effectively; (b) Dynamic: it can be aware of shifting trends by switching multi-aspect factors while summarizing their characteristics incrementally; and (c) Automatic: it finds every factor automatically without losing forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm extracts interpretable interactions between data attributes, while simultaneously providing improved forecasting accuracy and a great reduction in computational time."

In certain online marketplaces, however, e.g., on online auction sites, constantly new items are added to the catalog. In such cases, complementary item recommendations are often based on item side-information due to a lack of interaction data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can leverage both item side-information and labeled complementary item pairs to generate effective complementary recommendations for cold items, i.e., for items for which no co-purchase statistics yet exist. Given that complementary items typically have to be of a different category than the seed item, we technically maintain a latent space for each item category. Simultaneously, we learn to project distributed item representations into these category spaces to determine suitable recommendations. The main learning process in our architecture utilizes labeled pairs of complementary items. In addition, we adopt ideas from Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to leverage available item information even in case no labeled data exists for a given item and category. Experiments on three e-commerce datasets show that our method is highly effective."

This work advances the hypothesis that the very reactions that Information Operations seek to elicit within the target social systems can be used to detect them. We propose an Interval-censored Transformer Hawkes (IC-TH) architecture and a novel data encoding scheme to account for both observed and missing data. We derive a novel log-likelihood function that we deploy together with a contrastive learning procedure. We showcase the performance of IC-TH on three real-world Twitter datasets and two learning tasks: future popularity prediction and item category prediction. The latter is particularly significant. Using the retweeting timing and patterns solely, we can predict the category of YouTube videos, guess whether news publishers are reputable or controversial and, most importantly, identify state-backed IO agent accounts. Additional qualitative investigations uncover that the automatically discovered clusters of Russian-backed agents appear to coordinate their behavior, activating simultaneously to push specific narratives."

Despite the promising contributions of citation graphs, it is still challenging to incorporate them into summarization tasks. This is due to the difficulty of accurately identifying and leveraging relevant content in references for a source paper, as well as capturing their correlations of different intensities. Existing methods either ignore references or utilize only abstracts indiscriminately from them, failing to tackle the challenge mentioned above. To fill that gap, we propose a novel citation-aware scientific paper summarization framework based on the citation graph, able to accurately locate and incorporate the salient contents from references, as well as capture varying relevance between source papers and their references. Specifically, we first build a domain-specific dataset PubMedCite with about 192K biomedical scientific papers and a large citation graph preserving 917K citation relationships between them. It is characterized by preserving the salient contents extracted from full texts of references, and the weighted correlation between the salient contents of references and the source paper. Based on it, we design a self-supervised citation-aware summarization framework (CitationSum) with graph contrastive learning, which boosts the summarization generation by efficiently fusing the salient information in references with source paper contents under the guidance of their correlations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, due to efficiently leveraging the information of references and citation correlations."

At a higher level of the hierarchy, a decision-making module controls the post-processing of the attained feature engineering transformation. We extensively experiment with Catch on 26 academic standardized tabular datasets and 9 industrialized real-world datasets. Measured by numerous metrics and analyses, Catch establishes a new state-of-the-art, from perspectives performance, latency as well as its practicality towards production.

In this paper, we propose a novel Provenance of Training (PoT) scheme, the first empirical study towards verifying DNN model ownership without accessing any original dataset while being robust against existing attacks. At its core, PoT relies on a coherent model chain built from the intermediate checkpoints saved during model training to serve as the ownership certificate. Through an in-depth analysis of model training, we propose six key properties that a legitimate model chain shall naturally hold. In contrast, it is difficult for the adversary to forge a model chain that satisfies these properties simultaneously without performing actual training. We systematically analyze PoT’s robustness against various possible attacks, including the adaptive attacks that are designed given the full knowledge of PoT’s design, and further perform extensive empirical experiments to demonstrate our security analysis."

Several website fingerprinting attacks based on machine learning and deep learning tend to use the most typical features to achieve a satisfactory performance of attacking rate. However, these attacks suffer from several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing step or a clean dataset. To defend against such attacks, random packet defense (RPD) with a high cost of excessive network overhead is usually applied. In this work, we first propose a practical filter-assisted attack against RPD, which can filter out the injected noises using the statistical characteristics of TCP/IP traffic. Then, we propose a list-assisted defensive mechanism to defend the proposed attack method. To achieve a configurable trade-off between the defense and the network overhead, we further improve the list-based defense by a traffic splitting mechanism, which can combat the mentioned attacks as well as save a considerable amount of network overhead. In the experiments, we collect real-life traffic patterns using three mainstream browsers, i.e., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox, and extensive results conducted on the closed and open-world datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of defense accuracy and network efficiency."

Nevertheless, the openness also raises the concern of data poisoning attacks, that is, the attacker could submit malicious facts to bias the prediction of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. Existing studies on such attacks adopt a clear-box setting and neglect the semantic information of the generated facts, making them fail to attack in real-world scenarios. In this work, we consider a more rigorous setting and propose a model-agnostic, semantic, and stealthy data poisoning attack on KGE models from a practical perspective. The main design of our work is to inject indicative paths to make the infected model predict certain malicious facts. With the aid of the proposed opaque-box path injection theory, we theoretically reveal that the attack success rate under the opaque-box setting is determined by the plausibility of triplets on the indicative path. Based on this, we develop a novel and efficient algorithm to search paths that maximize the attack goal, satisfy certain semantic constraints, and preserve certain stealthiness, i.e., the normal functionality of the target KGE will not be influenced although it predicts wrong facts given certain queries. Through extensive evaluation of benchmark datasets and 6 typical knowledge graph embedding models as the victims, we validate the effectiveness in terms of attack success rate (ASR) under opaque-box setting and stealthiness. For example, on FB15k-237, our attack achieves a ASR on DeepPath, with an average ASR over when attacking various KGE models under the opaque-box setting."

Poisoning attacks on graphs are, however, non-trivial as the attack space is potentially large, and the discrete graph structure makes the poisoning function non-differentiable. In this paper, we revisit the bi-level optimization problem in graph poisoning and propose a novel graph poisoning method, termed Curriculum Graph Poisoning (CuGPo), inspired by curriculum learning. In contrast to other poisoning attacks that use heuristics or directly optimize the graph, our method learns to generate poisoned graphs from basic adversarial knowledge first and advanced knowledge later. Specifically, for the outer optimization, we utilize the slightly perturbed graphs which represent the easy poisoning task at the beginning, and then enlarge the attack space until the final; for the inner optimization, we firstly exploit the knowledge from the clean graph and then adapt quickly to perturbed graphs to obtain the adversarial knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CuGPo achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph poisoning attacks."

We observe that English data enriched in deepfake algorithms can teach a detector the knowledge of various spoofing artifacts, contributing to performing detection across language domains. Based on the observation, we first construct a first-of-its-kind cross-lingual evaluation dataset including heterogeneous spoofed speech uttered in the two most widely spoken languages, then explored domain adaptation (DA) techniques to transfer the artifacts detection capability and propose effective and practical DA strategies fitting the cross-lingual scenario. Our adversarial-based DA paradigm teaches the model to learn real/fake knowledge while losing language dependency. Extensive experiments over 137-hour audio clips validate the adapted models can detect fake audio generated by unseen algorithms in the new domain."

However, it is shown that these APIs are susceptible to model inversion attacks, where attackers can recover the training data with high fidelity, which may cause serious privacy leakage.Existing defenses against model inversion attacks, however, hinder the model performance and are ineffective for more advanced attacks, e.g., Mirror [4]. In this paper, we proposed NetGuard, a novel utility-aware defense methodology against model inversion attacks (MIAs). Unlike previous works that perturb prediction outputs of the victim model, we propose to mislead the MIA effort by inserting engineered fake samples during the training process. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is carefully built to construct fake training samples to mislead the attack model without degrading the performance of the victim model. Besides, we adopt continual learning to further improve the utility of the victim model. Extensive experiments on CelebA, VGG-Face, and VGG-Face2 datasets show that NetGuard is superior to existing defenses, including DP [37] and Ad-mi [32] on state-of-the-art model inversion attacks, i.e., DMI [8], Mirror [4], Privacy [12], and Alignment [34]."

Source camera identification of web photos aims to establish a reliable linkage from the captured images to their source cameras, and has a broad range of applications, such as image copyright protection, user authentication, investigated evidence verification, etc. This paper presents an innovative and practical source identification framework that employs neural-network enhanced sensor pattern noise to trace back web photos efficiently while ensuring security. Our proposed framework consists of three main stages: initial device fingerprint registration, fingerprint extraction and cryptographic connection establishment while taking photos, and connection verification between photos and source devices. By incorporating metric learning and frequency consistency into the deep network design, our proposed fingerprint extraction algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on modern smartphone photos for reliable source identification. Meanwhile, we also propose several optimization sub-modules to prevent fingerprint leakage and improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally for practical system design, two cryptographic schemes are introduced to reliably identify the correlation between registered fingerprint and verified photo fingerprint, i.e. fuzzy extractor and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). The codes for fingerprint extraction network and benchmark dataset with modern smartphone cameras photos are all publicly available at https://github.com/PhotoNecf/PhotoNecf 1."

However, the existing methods only extract flow-level features, failing to handle short flows because of unreliable statistical properties, or treat the header and payload equally, failing to mine the potential correlation between bytes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a byte-level traffic graph construction approach based on point-wise mutual information (PMI), and a model named Temporal Fusion Encoder using Graph Neural Networks (TFE-GNN) for feature extraction. In particular, we design a dual embedding layer, a GNN-based traffic graph encoder as well as a cross-gated feature fusion mechanism, which can first embed the header and payload bytes separately and then fuses them together to obtain a stronger feature representation. The experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate that TFE-GNN outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods in fine-grained encrypted traffic classification tasks."

Due to its high efficiency, Proof of Authority (PoA) Aura has become one of the most widely adopted consensus solutions for blockchains. Our research finds over 4,000 projects have used Aura and its variants. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of Aura. We propose three types of time-manipulation attacks, where a malicious leader simply needs to modify the timestamp in its proposed block or delay it to extract extra benefits. These attacks can easily break the legal leader election, thus directly harming the fairness of the block proposal. We apply our attacks to a mature Aura project called OpenEthereum. By repeatedly conducting our attacks1 over 15 days, we find that an adversary can gain on average 200% mining rewards of their fair shares. Furthermore, such attacks can even indirectly break the finality of blocks and the safety of the system. Based on the deployment of Aura as of September 2022, the potentially affected market cap is up to 2.13 billion USD. As a by-product, we further discuss solutions to mitigate such issues and report our observations to official teams."

In this work, we present Meteor, an online communication-efficient and fast secure 3-party computation neural network inference system aginst semi-honest adversary in honest-majority. The main contributions of Meteor are two-fold: i) We propose a new and improved 3-party secret sharing scheme stemming from the linearity of replicated secret sharing, and design efficient protocols for the basic cryptographic primitives, including linear operations, multiplication, most significant bit extraction, and multiplexer. ii) Furthermore, we build efficient and secure blocks for the widely used neural network operators such as Matrix Multiplication, ReLU, and Maxpool, along with exploiting several specific optimizations for better efficiency. Our total communication with the setup phase is a little larger than SecureNN (PoPETs’19) and Falcon (PoPETs’21), two state-of-the-art solutions, but the gap is not significant when the online phase must be optimized as a priority. Using Meteor, we perform extensive evaluations on various neural networks. Compared to SecureNN and Falcon, we reduce the online communication costs by up to 25.6 × and 1.5 ×, and improve the running-time by at most 9.8 × (resp. 8.1 ×) and 1.5 × (resp. 2.1 ×) in LAN (resp.

Hence, this paper aims to answer the question: Is the NFT-to-Asset connection fragile? This paper makes a first step towards this end by characterizing NFT-to-Asset connections of 12,353 Ethereum NFT Contracts (6,234,141 NFTs in total) from three perspectives, storage, accessibility, and duplication. In order to overcome challenges of affecting the measurement accuracy, e.g., IPFS instability and the changing availability of both IPFS and servers’ data, we propose to leverage multiple gateways to enlarge the data coverage and extend a longer measurement period with non-trivial efforts. Results of our extensive study show that such connection is very fragile in practice. The loss, unavailability, or duplication of off-chain assets could render the value of NFTs worthless. For instance, we find that assets of 25.24% of Ethereum NFT contracts are not accessible, and 21.48% of Ethereum NFT contracts include duplicated assets. Our work sheds light on the fragility along the NFT-to-Asset connection, which could help the NFT community to better enhance the trust of off-chain assets."

Albeit its supreme model accuracy, DL imposes a heavy burden on devices as it incurs overwhelming system overhead to execute DL models, especially on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge devices. Collaborative inference is a promising approach to supporting DL models, by which the data owner (the victim) runs the first layers of the model on her local device and then a cloud provider (the adversary) runs the remaining layers of the model. Compared to offloading the entire model to the cloud, the collaborative inference approach is more data privacy-preserving as the owner’s model input is not exposed to outsiders. However, we show in this paper that the adversary can restore the victim’s model input by exploiting the output of the victim’s local model. Our attack is dubbed Ginver 1: Generative model inversion attacks against collaborative inference. Once trained, Ginver can infer the victim’s unseen model inputs without remaking the inversion attack model and thus has the generative capability. We extensively evaluate Ginver under different settings (e.g., white-box and black-box of the victim’s local model) and applications (e.g., CIFAR10 and FaceScrub datasets). The experimental results show that Ginver recovers high-quality images from the victims."

In fact, by combining this tag with cookies that have rolling expiration dates, FB can also keep track of users’ browsing activities in the future as well. Our experimental results suggest that 23% of the 10k most popular websites have adopted this technology, and can contribute to this activity tracking on the web. Furthermore, our longitudinal study shows that this type of user activity tracking can go as far back as 2015.). Simply said, if a user creates for the first time a FB account today, FB could, under some conditions, match their anonymously collected past web browsing activity to their newly created FB profile, from as far back as 2015 and continue tracking their activity in the future."

We uncover several new vulnerabilities with serious consequences, e.g., allowing an attacker to take over all stores under a platform, and listing illegal products at a victim’s store—in addition to “shopping for free” bugs, without exploiting the checkout/payment process. We found 12 platforms vulnerable to store takeover (affecting 41000+ stores) and 6 platforms vulnerable to shopping for free (affecting 19000+ stores, approximated via Google dorks on Oct. 8, 2022).

Using a snowball-sampling strategy for the 200000 most popular domains of the Web, we first crawled a dataset of  8.5M webpages, from which we built, through an active-learning approach, a unique dataset of 277 diverse webpages that contain checksums. Our analysis of these webpages reveals interesting findings about the usage of checksums. For instance, it shows that checksums are used mostly to verify program files, that weak hash functions are frequently used, and that a non-negligible proportion of the checksums provided on webpages do not match that of their associated files. Finally, we complement our analysis with a survey of the webmasters of the considered webpages (N = 26), thus shedding light on the reasons behind the checksum-related choices they make."

In this paper, we explore the potential privacy issues and threats that exist in these apps. We investigate 20195 mobile apps from the Google Play store that are designed particularly for children (Family apps) or include children in their target user groups (Normal apps). Using both static and dynamic analysis, we find that 4.47% of Family apps request location permissions, even though collecting location information from children is forbidden by the Play store, and 81.25% of Family apps use trackers (which are not allowed in children’s apps). Even major developers with 40+ kids apps on the Play store use ad trackers. Furthermore, we find that most permission request notifications are not well designed for children, and 19.25% apps have inconsistent content age ratings across the different protection authorities. Our findings suggest that, despite significant attention to children’s privacy, a large gap between regulatory provisions, app store policies, and actual development practices exist.

Our system discovers 231 fingerprinting APIs in Alexa top 10K domains, starting with only 35 commonly known fingerprinting APIs and 17 data transmission APIs. Out of 231 APIs, 161 of them are not identified by state-of-the-art detection systems.

To address these challenges, we propose BERT4ETH, a universal pre-trained Transformer encoder that serves as an account representation extractor for detecting various fraud behaviors on Ethereum. BERT4ETH features the superior modeling capability of Transformer to capture the dynamic sequential patterns inherent in Ethereum transactions, and addresses the challenges of pre-training a BERT model for Ethereum with three practical and effective strategies, namely repetitiveness reduction, skew alleviation and heterogeneity modeling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that BERT4ETH outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant enhancements in terms of the phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks.

Bug-bounty programs enable organizations to enhance their security posture by harnessing the diverse expertise of crowds of external security experts (i.e., bug hunters). Nonetheless, quantifying the benefits of bug-bounty programs remains elusive, which presents a significant challenge for managing them. Previous studies focused on measuring their benefits in terms of the number of vulnerabilities reported or based on the properties of the reported vulnerabilities, such as severity or exploitability. However, beyond these inherent properties, the value of a report also depends on the probability that the vulnerability would be discovered by a threat actor before an internal expert could discover and patch it. In this paper, we present a data-driven study of the Chromium and Firefox vulnerability-reward programs. First, we estimate the difficulty of discovering a vulnerability using the probability of rediscovery as a novel metric. Our findings show that vulnerability discovery and patching provide clear benefits by making it difficult for threat actors to find vulnerabilities; however, we also identify opportunities for improvement, such as incentivizing bug hunters to focus more on development releases. Second, we compare the types of vulnerabilities that are discovered internally vs. externally and those that are exploited by threat actors. We observe significant differences between vulnerabilities found by external bug hunters, internal security teams, and external threat actors, which indicates that bug-bounty programs provide an important benefit by complementing the expertise of internal teams, but also that external hunters should be incentivized more to focus on the types of vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploited by threat actors."

Although network operators may attempt a network-wide detection of trackers through inspecting all web traffic inside the network, their methods are not only privacy-intrusive but of limited accuracy as these are susceptible to domain changes or ineffective against encrypted traffic. To this end, in this paper, we propose Net-track, a novel approach to managing a secure web environment through platform-independent, encryption-agnostic detection of trackers. Utilizing only side-channel data from network traffic that are still available when encrypted, Net-track accurately detects trackers network-wide, irrespective of user’s browsers or devices without looking into packet payloads or resources fetched from the web server. This prevents user data from leaking to tracking servers in a privacy-preserving manner. By measuring statistics from traffic traces and their similarities, we show distinctions between benign traffic and tracker traffic in their traffic patterns and build Net-track based on the features that fully capture trackers’ distinctive characteristics. Evaluation results show that Net-track is able to detect trackers with 94.02% accuracy and can even discover new trackers yet unrecognized by existing filter lists. Furthermore, Net-track shows its potential for real-time detection, maintaining its performance when using only a portion of each traffic trace."

Proactive web defacements have not yet received attention from research communities, anti-hacking organizations, or law-enforcement officials. To detect proactive web defacements, we designed a practical tool, PACTOR. It runs in the browser and intercepts JavaScript API calls that manipulate web page content. It takes snapshots of the rendered HTML source code immediately before and after the intercepted API calls and detects proactive web defacements by visually comparing every two consecutive snapshots. Our two-month empirical study, using PACTOR, on 2,454 incidents of proactive web defacements shows that they can evade existing URL safety-checking tools and effectively promote the ranking of their landing pages using legitimate content/keywords. We also investigated the vendor network of proactive web defacements and reported all the involved domains to law-enforcement officials and URL-safety checking tools."

Recent studies find that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective backdoor attacks on graphs are still an open problem. In particular, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. The backdoored GNNs trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes to target class once attached with triggers. Though there are some initial efforts in graph backdoor attacks, our empirical analysis shows that they may require a large attack budget for effective backdoor attacks and the injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with limited attack budget. To fully utilize the attack budget, we propose to deliberately select the nodes to inject triggers and target class labels in the poisoning phase. An adaptive trigger generator is deployed to obtain effective triggers that are difficult to be noticed. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets against various defense strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in conducting effective unnoticeable backdoor attacks."

The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets.

However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread.

We introduce a case-based reasoning model, EvCBR, to predict properties about new consequent events based on similar cause-effect events present in the KG. EvCBR uses statistical measures to identify similar events and performs path-based predictions, requiring no training step. To generalize our methods beyond the domain of event prediction, we frame our task as a 2-hop LP task, where the first hop is a causal relation connecting a cause event to a new effect event and the second hop is a property about the new event which we wish to predict. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated using a novel dataset of newsworthy events with causal relations curated from Wikidata, where EvCBR outperforms baselines including translational-distance-based, GNN-based, and rule-based LP models."

However, existing models suffer from the problem of generating “over-generic” descriptions, such as their tendency to generate repetitive sentences with common concepts for different images. These generic descriptions fail to provide sufficient textual semantics for ever-changing web images. Inspired by the recent success of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models that learn diverse image-text concept alignment during pretraining, we explore leveraging their cross-modal pre-trained knowledge to automatically enrich the textual semantics of image descriptions. With no need for additional human annotations, we propose a plug-and-play framework, i.e CapEnrich, to complement the generic image descriptions with more semantic details. Specifically, we first propose an automatic data-building strategy to get desired training sentences, based on which we then adopt prompting strategies, i.e. learnable and template prompts, to incentivize VLP models to generate more textual details. For learnable templates, we fix the whole VLP model and only tune the prompt vectors, which leads to two advantages: 1) the pre-training knowledge of VLP models can be reserved as much as possible to describe diverse visual concepts; 2) only lightweight trainable parameters are required, so it is friendly to low data resources. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the descriptiveness and diversity of generated sentences for web images.

To date, it contains more than 17 billion triples collecting information about people, places, films, stars, publications, proteins, and many more. On the other side, most of the information on the Web is not published in highly structured data repositories like Wikidata, but rather as unstructured and semi-structured content, more concretely in HTML pages containing text and tables. Finding, monitoring, and organizing this data in a knowledge graph is requiring considerable work from human editors. The volume and complexity of the data make this task difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we present a framework that is able to identify and extract new facts that are published under multiple Web domains so that they can be proposed for validation by Wikidata editors. The framework is relying on question-answering technologies. We take inspiration from ideas that are used to extract facts from textual collections and adapt them to extract facts from Web pages. For achieving this, we demonstrate that language models can be adapted to extract facts not only from textual collections but also from Web pages. By exploiting the information already contained in Wikidata the proposed framework can be trained without the need for any additional learning signals and can extract new facts for a wide range of properties and domains. Following this path, Wikidata can be used as a seed to extract facts on the Web. Our experiments show that we can achieve a mean performance of 84.07 at F1-score. Moreover, our estimations show that we can potentially extract millions of facts that can be proposed for human validation. The goal is to help editors in their daily tasks and contribute to the completion of the Wikidata knowledge graph."

Specifically, to explicitly associate entities in different timestamps, we first transform the TKG into a global graph. Based on the built graph, we design a Hierarchical Relational Graph Neural Network that executes in two levels: The sub-graph level is to capture the semantic dependencies within concurrent facts of each KG. And the global-graph level aims to model the temporal dependencies between entities. Furthermore, we design a module to extract the long- and short-term information from the output of these two levels.

In this work, by focusing on a certain class of first-order logic rules that are sufficiently expressive, we develop a highly efficient MLN inference engine called MLN4KB that can leverage the sparsity of knowledge bases. MLN4KB enjoys quite strong theoretical properties; its space and time complexities can be exponentially smaller than existing MLN engines. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world knowledge bases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. MLN4KB is orders of magnitudes faster (more than 103 times faster on some datasets) than existing MLN engines in the open-world setting. Without any approximation tricks, MLN4KB can scale to real-world knowledge bases including WN-18 and YAGO3-10 and achieve decent prediction accuracy without bells and whistles."

Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines."

Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding represents KGs in a continuous vector space, serving as the backbone of many knowledge-driven applications. As a promising combination, federated KG embedding can fully take advantage of knowledge learned from different clients while preserving the privacy of local data. However, realistic problems such as data heterogeneity and knowledge forgetting still remain to be concerned. In this paper, we propose FedLU, a novel FL framework for heterogeneous KG embedding learning and unlearning. To cope with the drift between local optimization and global convergence caused by data heterogeneity, we propose mutual knowledge distillation to transfer local knowledge to global, and absorb global knowledge back. Moreover, we present an unlearning method based on cognitive neuroscience, which combines retroactive interference and passive decay to erase specific knowledge from local clients and propagate to the global model by reusing knowledge distillation. We construct new datasets for assessing realistic performance of the state-of-the-arts. Extensive experiments show that FedLU achieves superior results in both link prediction and knowledge forgetting."

The characteristics of persistent homology allow to evaluate the quality of the KG completion looking only at a fraction of the data. Experimental results on standard datasets show that the proposed metric is highly correlated with ranking metrics (Hits@N, MR, MRR). Performance evaluation shows that is computationally efficient: In some cases, the evaluation time (validation+test) of a KG completion method has been reduced from 18 hours (using Hits@10) to 27 seconds (using ), and on average (across methods & data) reduces the evaluation time (validation+test) by ≈ 99.96%."

Given the continued and rapid emergence of new entities, maintaining a comprehensive taxonomy in a timely manner through human annotation is prohibitively expensive. Therefore, expanding a taxonomy automatically with new entities is essential. Most existing methods for expanding taxonomies encode entities into vector embeddings (i.e., single points). However, we argue that vectors are insufficient to model the “is-a” hierarchy in taxonomy (asymmetrical relation), because two points can only represent pairwise similarity (symmetrical relation). To this end, we propose to project taxonomy entities into boxes (i.e., hyperrectangles). Two boxes can be \"contained\", \"disjoint\" and \"intersecting\", thus naturally representing an asymmetrical taxonomic hierarchy. Upon box embeddings, we propose a novel model BoxTaxo for taxonomy expansion. The core of BoxTaxo is to learn boxes for entities to capture their child-parent hierarchies. To achieve this, BoxTaxo optimizes the box embeddings from a joint view of geometry and probability. BoxTaxo also offers an easy and natural way for inference: examine whether the box of a given new entity is fully enclosed inside the box of a candidate parent from the existing taxonomy. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BoxTaxo compared to vector based models."

Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries. The inferred high quality queries will be returned to the users to help them search with ease. Moreover, all the high-quality candidate nodes will be re-ranked according to the inferred queries.

In this paper, we present Atrapos, a new approach for the real-time evaluation of metapath query workloads that leverages a combination of efficient sparse matrix multiplication and intermediate result caching. Atrapos selects intermediate results to cache and reuse by detecting frequent sub-metapaths among workload queries in real time, using a tailor-made data structure, the Overlap Tree, and an associated caching policy. Our experimental study on real data shows that Atrapos  accelerates exploratory data analysis and mining on HINs, outperforming off-the-shelf caching approaches and state-of-the-art research prototypes in all examined scenarios."

In this paper, we propose a novel attribute-consistent knowledge graph representation learning framework for MMEA (ACK-MMEA) to compensate the contextual gaps through incorporating consistent alignment knowledge. Attribute-consistent KGs (ACKGs) are first constructed via multi-modal attribute uniformization with merge and generate operators so that each entity has one and only one uniform feature in each modality. The ACKGs are then fed into a relation-aware graph neural network with random dropouts, to obtain aggregated relation representations and robust entity representations. In order to evaluate the ACK-MMEA facilitated for entity alignment, we specially design a joint alignment loss for both entity and attribute evaluation.

Using self-supervision data, TaxoComplete learns a position-enhanced node representation using two components: (1) a query-anchor semantic matching mechanism, which encodes pairs of nodes and matches their semantic distance to their graph distance, such that nodes that are close in the taxonomy are placed closely in the shared embedding space while distant nodes are placed further apart; (2) a direction-aware propagation module, which embeds the direction of edges in node representation, such that we discriminate <node, parent> relation from other taxonomic relations. Our approach allows the representation of nodes to encapsulate information from a large neighborhood while being aware of the distance separating pairs of nodes in the taxonomy.

To understand complex questions, existing studies employ language models (LMs) to encode contexts. Despite the simplicity, they neglect the latent relational information among question concepts and answers in KGs. While question concepts ubiquitously present hyponymy at the semantic level, e.g., mammals and animals, this feature is identically reflected in the hierarchical relations in KGs, e.g., a_type_of. Therefore, we are motivated to explore comprehensive reasoning by the hierarchical structures in KGs to help understand questions. However, it is non-trivial to reason over tree-like structures compared with chained paths. Moreover, identifying appropriate hierarchies relies on expertise. To this end, we propose HamQA, a novel Hierarchy-aware multi-hop Question Answering framework on knowledge graphs, to effectively align the mutual hierarchical information between question contexts and KGs. The entire learning is conducted in Hyperbolic space, inspired by its advantages of embedding hierarchical structures. Specifically, (i) we design a context-aware graph attentive network to capture context information. (ii) Hierarchical structures are continuously preserved in KGs by minimizing the Hyperbolic geodesic distances. The comprehensive reasoning is conducted to jointly train both components and provide a top-ranked candidate as an optimal answer. We achieve a higher ranking than the state-of-the-art multi-hop baselines on the official OpenBookQA leaderboard with an accuracy of 85%."

State-of-the-art time-aware EA studies have suggested that the temporal information of TKGs facilitates the performance of EA. However, existing studies have not thoroughly exploited the advantages of temporal information in TKGs. Also, they perform EA by pre-aligning entity pairs, which can be labor-intensive and thus inefficient. In this paper, we present DualMatch that effectively fuses the relational and temporal information for EA. DualMatch transfers EA on TKGs into a weighted graph matching problem. More specifically, DualMatch is equipped with an unsupervised method, which achieves EA without necessitating the seed alignment. DualMatch has two steps: (i) encoding temporal and relational information into embeddings separately using a novel label-free encoder, Dual-Encoder; and (ii) fusing both information and transforming it into alignment using a novel graph-matching-based decoder, GM-Decoder. DualMatch is able to perform EA on TKGs with or without supervision, due to its capability of effectively capturing temporal information. Extensive experiments on three real-world TKG datasets offer the insight that DualMatch significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

However, the existing TKG is usually incomplete. It has become a hot research task to infer missing facts based on existing facts in a TKG; namely, Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion (TKGC). The current mainstream TKGC models are embedded models that predict missing facts by representing entities, relations and timestamps as low-dimensional vectors. In order to deal with the TKG structure information, there are some models that try to introduce attention mechanism into the embedding process. But they only consider the structure information of entities or relations, and ignore the structure information of the whole TKG. Moreover, most of them usually treat timestamps as a general feature and cannot take advantage of the potential time series information of the timestamp. To solve these problems, wo propose a new Hierarchical Self-Attention Embedding (HSAE) model which inspired by self-attention mechanism and diachronic embedding technique. For structure information of the whole TKG, we divide the TKG into two layers: entity layer and relation layer, and then apply the self-attention mechanism to the entity layer and relation layer respectively to capture the structure information. For time series information of the timestamp, we capture them by combining positional encoding and diachronic embedding technique into the above two self-attention layers. Finally, we can get the embedded representation vectors of entities, relations and timestamps, which can be combined with other models for better results. We evaluate our model on three TKG datasets: ICEWS14, ICEWS05-15 and GDELT. Experimental results on the TKGC (interpolation) task demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results."

Firstly, we propose the Knowledge Relational Attention Network (KRAT) to leverage the graph context by simultaneously projecting neighboring triples to different latent spaces and jointly aggregating messages with the attention mechanism. KRAT is capable of capturing the subtle semantic information and importance of different context triples as well as leveraging multi-hop information in knowledge graphs. Secondly, we propose the knowledge contrastive loss by combining the contrastive loss with cross entropy loss, which introduces more negative samples and thus enriches the feedback to sparse entities. Our experiments demonstrate that KRACL achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks, especially on WN18RR and NELL-995 which have large numbers of low in-degree entities. Extensive experiments also bear out KRACL’s effectiveness in handling sparse knowledge graphs and robustness against noisy triples."

In this paper, we vision a more practical scenario called labeling-based iterative relevance search: instead of effortfully inputting example answer entities, the user effortlessly (e.g., implicitly) labels current answer entities, and is rewarded with improved answer entities in the next iteration. To realize the scenario, our approach TRAVERS incorporates two rankers: a diversity-oriented ranker for supporting cold start and avoiding converging to sub-optimum caused by noisy labels, and a relevance-oriented ranker capable of handling unbalanced labels.

For utilization, we propose a general prompt-tuning mechanism regarding task data as a triple prompt to allow flexible interactions between task KGs and task data. We evaluate pretrained KGTransformer on three tasks, triple classification, zero-shot image classification, and question answering.

This may cause incorrect matching between KGs if such entity dynamics is ignored. In this paper, we propose a time-aware entity alignment (TEA) model that discovers the entity evolving behaviour by exploring the time contexts in KGs and aggregates various contextual information to make the alignment decision. In particular, we address two main challenges in the TEA model: 1) How to identify highly-correlated temporal facts; 2) How to capture entity dynamics and incorporate it to learn a more informative entity representation for the alignment task.

Knowledge graph embeddings map nodes into a vector space to predict new links, scoring them according to geometric criteria. Relations in the graph may follow patterns that can be learned, e.g., some relations might be symmetric and others might be hierarchical. However, the learning capability of different embedding models varies for each pattern and, so far, no single model can learn all patterns equally well. In this paper, we combine the query representations from several models in a unified one to incorporate patterns that are independently captured by each model. Our combination uses attention to select the most suitable model to answer each query. The models are also mapped onto a non-Euclidean manifold, the Poincaré ball, to capture structural patterns, such as hierarchies, besides relational patterns, such as symmetry. We prove that our combination provides a higher expressiveness and inference power than each model on its own. As a result, the combined model can learn relational and structural patterns. We conduct extensive experimental analysis with various link prediction benchmarks showing that the combined model outperforms individual models, including state-of-the-art approaches."

However, most of them are designed to learn from the observed graph structure, which appears to have imbalanced relation distribution during the training stage. Motivated by the causal relationship among the entities on a knowledge graph, we explore this defect through a counterfactual question: “would the relation still exist if the neighborhood of entities became different from observation?”. With a carefully designed instantiation of a causal model on the knowledge graph, we generate the counterfactual relations to answer the question by regarding the representations of entity pair given relation as context, structural information of relation-aware neighborhood as treatment, and validity of the composed triplet as the outcome. Furthermore, we incorporate the created counterfactual relations with the GNN-based framework on KGs to augment their learning of entity pair representations from both the observed and counterfactual relations. Experiments on benchmarks show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on the task of KGC, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed counterfactual relations-based augmentation also enhances the interpretability of the GNN-based framework through the path interpretations of predictions."

To tackle this problem, in this study, disaster-related Twitter data is incorporated as a covariate to understand the public awareness and attention about the disaster events and thus perceive their impacts on the human mobility. Accordingly, we propose a Meta-knowledge-Memorizable Spatio-Temporal Network (MemeSTN), which leverages memory network and meta-learning to fuse social media and human mobility data. Extensive experiments over three real-world disasters including Japan 2019 typhoon season, Japan 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and US 2019 hurricane season were conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Compared to the state-of-the-art spatio-temporal deep models and multivariate-time-series deep models, our model can achieve superior performance for nowcasting human mobility in disaster situations at both country level and state level."

We found that comment deletion decreased subsequent rule-breaking behavior in shorter threads (20 or fewer comments), even among other participants, suggesting that the intervention prevented conversations from derailing. Further, the effect of deletion on the affected user’s subsequent rule-breaking behavior was longer-lived than its effect on reducing commenting in general, suggesting that users were deterred from rule-breaking but not from commenting. In contrast, hiding (rather than deleting) content had small and statistically insignificant effects. Our results suggest that automated content moderation increases adherence to community guidelines."

In particular, we adopt a causal-inference framework to examine the impact of exposure to mental health coping stories on individuals on Twitter. We obtain a Twitter dataset with ∼ 2M posts by ∼ 10K individuals. We consider engaging with coping stories as the Treatment intervention, and adopt a stratified propensity score approach to find matched cohorts of Treatment and Control individuals. We measure the psychosocial shifts in affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes in longitudinal Twitter data before and after engaging with the coping stories.

As such, investment discussion boards became the de facto communities where traders create, disseminate, and discuss investing ideas. These communities, which can provide useful information to support investors, have anecdotally also attracted a wide range of misbehavior – toxicity, spam/fraud, and reputation manipulation. This paper is the first comprehensive analysis of online misbehavior in the context of investment communities. We study TradingView, the largest online communication platform for financial trading. We collect 2.76M user profiles with their corresponding social graphs, 4.2M historical article posts, and 5.3M comments, including information on nearly 4 000 suspended accounts and 17 000 removed comments. Price fluctuations seem to drive abuse across the platform and certain types of assets, such as “meme” stocks, attract disproportionate misbehavior. Suspended user accounts tend to form more closely-knit communities than those formed by non-suspended accounts; and paying accounts are less likely to be suspended than free accounts even when posting similar levels of content violating platform policies. We conclude by offering guidelines on how to adapt content moderation efforts to fit the particularities of online investment communities."

While professional fact-checkers form the first line of defense by fact-checking popular false claims, they do not engage directly in conversations with misinformation spreaders. On the other hand, non-expert ordinary users act as eyes-on-the-ground who proactively counter misinformation – recent research has shown that 96% counter-misinformation responses are made by ordinary users. However, research also found that 2/3 times, these responses are rude and lack evidence. This work seeks to create a counter-misinformation response generation model to empower users to effectively correct misinformation. This objective is challenging due to the absence of datasets containing ground-truth of ideal counter-misinformation responses, and the lack of models that can generate responses backed by communication theories. In this work, we create two novel datasets of misinformation and counter-misinformation response pairs from in-the-wild social media and crowdsourcing from college-educated students. We annotate the collected data to distinguish poor from ideal responses that are factual, polite, and refute misinformation. We propose MisinfoCorrect, a reinforcement learning-based framework that learns to generate counter-misinformation responses for an input misinformation post. The model rewards the generator to increase the politeness, factuality, and refutation attitude while retaining text fluency and relevancy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows that our model outperforms several baselines by generating high-quality counter-responses. This work illustrates the promise of generative text models for social good – here, to help create a safe and reliable information ecosystem.

Existing works do not pay adequate attention to the massive battle. They either seek to evaluate individuals in isolation or mine simple pair-wise interactions between individuals, neither of which effectively captures the intricate interactions between massive units (e.g., individuals). Furthermore, as the team size increases, the phenomenon of diminishing marginal utility of units emerges. Such a diminishing pattern is rarely noticed in previous work, and how to capture it from data remains a challenge. To this end, we propose a novel Massive battle outcome predictor with margiNal Effect modules, namely MassNE, which comprehensively incorporates individual effects, cooperation effects (i.e., intra-team interactions) and suppression effects (i.e., inter-team interactions) for predicting battle outcomes. Specifically, we design marginal effect modules to learn how units’ marginal utility changing respect to their number, where the monotonicity assumption is applied to ensure rationality. In addition, we evaluate the current classical models and provide mathematical proofs that MassNE is able to generalize several earlier works in massive settings. Massive battle datasets generated by StarCraft II APIs are adopted to evaluate the performances of MassNE. Extensive experiments empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MassNE, and MassNE can reveal reasonable cooperation effects, suppression effects, and marginal utilities of combat units from the data."

Our results reveal that although new hires are gradually expanding networks over time, there still exists significant gaps between their network statistics and those of tenured employees even after the six-month onboarding phase. We also observe that heterogeneity exists among new employees in how their networks change over time, where employees whose job tasks do not necessarily require extensive and diverse connections could be at a disadvantaged position in this onboarding process. By investigating how web-based people recommendations in organizational knowledge base facilitate new employees naturally expand their networks, we also demonstrate the potential of web-based applications for addressing the aforementioned socialization challenges. Altogether, our findings provide insights on new employee network dynamics in remote and hybrid work environments, which may help guide organizational leaders and web application developers on quantifying and improving the socialization experiences of new employees in digital workplaces."

Our investigation is driven by website complexity analysis as well as evaluation through a recently proposed affordability index. Our analysis reveals that, in general, public service websites in developing countries do not meet the affordability target set by the UN’s Broadband Commission.

In this work, we study differences between political Facebook ads in English and Spanish during 2020, the latest U.S. presidential election. Political advertisers spent $ 1.48 B in English, but only $ 28.8 M in Spanish, disproportionately little compared to the share of Spanish speakers in the population. We further find a lower proportion of election-related advertisers (which additionally are more liberal-leaning than in the English set), and a higher proportion of government agencies in the set of Spanish ads. We perform multilingual topic classification, finding that the most common ad topics in English were also present in Spanish, but to a different extent, and with a different composition of advertisers. Thus, Spanish speakers are served different types of ads from different types of advertisers than English speakers, and in lower amounts; these results raise the question of whether political communication through Facebook ads may be inequitable and effectively disadvantaging the sizeable minority of Spanish speakers in the U.S. population."

We identify the companies that advertise in fake news websites and the intermediary companies responsible for facilitating those ad revenues. We study more than 2,400 popular news websites and show that well-known ad networks, such as Google and IndexExchange, have a direct advertising relation with more than 40% of fake news websites.

Thus, to understand the online ad ecosystem during this conflict, we conducted a five-month long large-scale measurement study of online advertising in Ukraine, Russia, and the US. We studied advertising trends of ad platforms that delivered ads in Ukraine, Russia, and the US and conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of the conflict-related ad content. We found that prominent US-based advertisers continued to support Russian websites, and a portion of online ads were used to spread conflict-related information, including protesting the invasion, and spreading awareness, which might have otherwise potentially been censored in Russia."

Combined, these accounts posted over 14 million toxic comments that encompass insults, identity attacks, threats of violence, and sexual harassment. We explore the impact that these accounts have on Reddit, the targeting strategies that abusive accounts adopt, and the distinct patterns that distinguish classes of abusive accounts.

These online reviews often contain detailed descriptions of a school’s strengths and weaknesses, which both reflect and inform perceptions of a school. Existing work on these text reviews has focused on finding words or themes that underlie these perceptions, but has stopped short of using the textual reviews as leading indicators of school performance. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the language used in online reviews of a school is predictive of changes in the attributes of that school, such as its socio-economic makeup and student test scores. Using over 300K reviews of 70K U.S. schools from a popular ratings website, we apply language processing models to predict whether schools will significantly increase or decrease in an attribute of interest over a future time horizon. We find that using the text improves predictive performance significantly over a baseline model that does not include text but only the historical time-series of the indicators themselves, suggesting that the review text carries predictive power. A qualitative analysis of the most predictive terms and phrases used in the text reviews indicates a number of topics that serve as leading indicators, such as diversity, changes in school leadership, a focus on testing, and school safety."

To improve the prediction and interpretability of pure data-driven deep learning with only a limited amount of labeled data, a pervasive trend is to assist the model training with knowledge priors from online medical knowledge graphs. However, they marginally investigated the label imbalance and the task-irrelevant noise in the external knowledge graph. The imbalanced label distribution would bias the learning and knowledge extraction towards the majority categories. The task-irrelevant noise introduces extra uncertainty to the model performance. To this end, aiming at by-passing the bias-variance trade-off dilemma, we introduce a new sequential learning framework, dubbed SeqCare, for diagnosis prediction with online medical knowledge graphs. Concretely, in the first step, SeqCare learns a bias-reduced space through a self-supervised graph contrastive learning task. Secondly, SeqCare reduces the learning uncertainty by refining the supervision signal and the graph structure of the knowledge graph simultaneously. Lastly, SeqCare trains the model in the bias-variance reduced space with a self-distillation to further filter out irrelevant information in the data. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets show that SeqCare outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Case studies exemplify the interpretability of SeqCare. Moreover, the medical findings discovered by SeqCare are consistent with experts and medical literature."

In this paper, we attempt to extend the local-user fine-tuning to multi-user fed-tuning with the help of Federated Learning (FL). Following the new paradigm, we propose EEFT, a framework aiming to achieve Efficient and Effective Fed-Tuning for mobile/web users. The key idea is to introduce lightweight but effective adaptation modules to the pre-trained model, such that we can freeze the pre-trained model and just focus on optimizing the modules to achieve cost reduction and selective task cooperation.

For each user request, a few of the microservices are called, and a trace is formed to record the tree-like call dependencies among microservices and the time consumption at each call node. Traces are useful in diagnosing system failures, but their complex structures make it difficult to model their patterns and detect their anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-variable graph variational autoencoder (VAE) for unsupervised anomaly detection on microservice traces. To reconstruct the time consumption of nodes, we propose a novel dispatching layer. We find that the inversion of negative log-likelihood (NLL) appears for some anomalous samples, which makes the anomaly score infeasible for anomaly detection. To address this, we point out that the NLL can be decomposed into KL-divergence and data entropy, whereas lower-dimensional anomalies can introduce an entropy gap with normal inputs. We propose three techniques to mitigate this entropy gap for trace anomaly detection: Bernoulli & Categorical Scaling, Node Count Normalization, and Gaussian Std-Limit. On five trace datasets from a top Internet company, our proposed TraceVAE achieves excellent F-scores."

To reduce the traffic overheads incurred by FL systems, edge servers have been included between clients and the parameter server to aggregate clients’ local models. Recent studies on this edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme have focused on ensuring or accelerating model convergence by coping with various factors, e.g., uncertain network conditions, unreliable clients, heterogeneous compute resources, etc. This paper presents our three new discoveries of the edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme: 1) it wastes significant time during its two-phase training rounds; 2) it does not recognize or utilize model diversity when producing a global model; and 3) it is vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose FedEdge, a novel edge-assisted hierarchical FL scheme that accelerates model training with asynchronous local federated training and adaptive model aggregation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used public datasets. The results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art FL schemes, FedEdge accelerates model convergence by 1.14 × −3.20 ×, and improves model accuracy by 2.14% - 6.63%."

A common approach to AI-based monitoring is to detect causal relationships among service components and build a causal graph. Availability of domain information makes cloud systems even better suited for such causal detection approaches. In modern cloud systems, however, auto-scalers dynamically change the number of microservice instances, and a load-balancer manages the load on each instance. This poses a challenge for off-the-shelf causal structure detection techniques as they neither incorporate the system architectural domain information nor provide a way to model distributed compute across varying numbers of service instances. To address this, we develop CausIL, which detects a causal structure among service metrics by considering compute distributed across dynamic instances and incorporating domain knowledge derived from system architecture. Towards the application in cloud systems, CausIL estimates a causal graph using instance-specific variations in performance metrics, modeling multiple instances of a service as independent, conditional on system assumptions. Simulation study shows the efficacy of CausIL over baselines by improving graph estimation accuracy by ∼ 25% as measured by Structural Hamming Distance whereas the real-world dataset demonstrates CausIL’s applicability in deployment settings."

Following this trend, Web of Things (WoT) further enables fast and efficient creation of various applications that perceive and act on the physical world using standard Web technologies. A popular way for creating WoT applications is Trigger-Action Programming (TAP), which allows users to orchestrate the capabilities of IoT devices in the form of “if trigger, then action”. However, existing TAP approaches don’t support scenario-centric WoT applications which involve abstract modeling of physical environments and complex spatio-temporal dependencies between events and actions. In this paper, we propose an approach called SCTAP which supports Scenario-Centric Trigger-Action Programming based on software-defined physical environments. SCTAP defines a structured and conceptual representation for physical environments, which provides the required programming abstractions for WoT applications. Based on the representation, SCTAP defines a grammar for specifying scenario-centric WoT applications with spatio-temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we design a service-based architecture for SCTAP which supports the integration of device access, event perception, environment representation, and rule execution in a loosely-coupled and extensible way. We implement SCTAP as a WoT infrastructure and evaluate it with two case studies including a smart laboratory and a smart coffee house. The results confirm the usability, feasibility and efficiency of SCTAP and its implementation."

It allows the cloud service provider to sell more resources than the physical limit, assuming not all users would fully utilize the resources simultaneously. However, how to design an oversubscription policy that improves utilization while satisfying some safety constraints remains an open problem. Existing methods and industrial practices are over-conservative, ignoring the coordination of diverse resource usage patterns and probabilistic constraints. To address these two limitations, this paper formulates the oversubscription for cloud as a chance-constrained optimization problem and proposes an effective Chance-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (C2MARL) method to solve this problem. Specifically, C2MARL reduces the number of constraints by considering their upper bounds and leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning paradigm to learn a safe and optimal coordination policy. We evaluate our C2MARL on an internal cloud platform and public cloud datasets. Experiments show that our C2MARL outperforms existing methods in improving utilization () under different levels of safety constraints."

To ensure online services’ availability, quickly localizing the root causes of system failures is crucial. Given the high resource consumption of traces, call metric data are widely used by existing approaches to construct call graphs in practice. However, ambiguous correspondences between upstream and downstream calls may exist and result in exploring unexpected edges in the constructed call graph. Conducting root cause localization on this graph may lead to misjudgments of real root causes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate such ambiguity, which is overlooked in the existing literature. Inspired by the law of large numbers and the Markov properties of network traffic, we propose a regression-based method (named AmSitor) to address this problem effectively. Based on AmSitor, we propose an ambiguity-aware root cause localization approach based on Call Metric Data named CMDiagnostor, containing metric anomaly detection, ambiguity-free call graph construction, root cause exploration, and candidate root cause ranking modules. The comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on real-world datasets show that our CMDiagnostor can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches by 14% on the top-5 hit rate. Moreover, AmSitor can also be applied to existing baseline approaches separately to improve their performances one step further.

Such morphology analysis enables Vetter to detect visual distortions accurately and reliably. Vetter further diagnoses the detected visual distortions to pinpoint the root causes in WPOs’ source code. This is achieved by morphological causal inference, which localizes the offending visual elements that trigger the distortion and maps them to the corresponding code.

Therefore, many frameworks are emerging to support the development of XR in web browsers. However, little has been known about how well these frameworks perform and how complex XR apps modern web browsers can support on mobile devices. To fill the knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of mobile XR in web browsers. We select seven most popular web-based XR frameworks and investigate their runtime performance, including 3D rendering, camera capturing, and real-world understanding. We find that current frameworks have the potential to further enhance their performance by increasing GPU utilization or improving computing parallelism. Besides, for 3D scenes with good rendering performance, developers can feel free to add camera capturing with little influence on performance to support augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) applications. Based on our findings, we draw several practical implications to provide better XR support in web browsers."

We design a structure named dynamic causal curves to portray time-varying service dependencies and a temporal dynamics discovery algorithm based on Granger causal intervals. Our algorithm generates a smoother space of causal curves and designs the concept of causal unimodalization to calibrate the causality infidelities brought by missing metrics. Finally, a path search algorithm on dynamic causality graphs is proposed to pinpoint the root cause.

FL allows edge mobile and WoT devices to train a shared global ML model under the orchestration of a central parameter server. In the real world, due to resource heterogeneity, these edge devices often train different versions of models (e.g., VGG-16 and VGG-19) or different ML models (e.g., VGG and ResNet) for the same ML task (e.g., computer vision and speech recognition). Existing FL schemes have assumed that participating edge devices share a common model architecture, and thus cannot facilitate FL across edge devices with heterogeneous ML model architectures. We explored this architecture heterogeneity challenge and found that FL can and should accommodate these edge devices to improve model accuracy and accelerate model training. This paper presents our findings and FlexiFed, a novel scheme for FL across edge devices with heterogeneous model architectures, and three model aggregation strategies for accommodating architecture heterogeneity under FlexiFed. Experiments with four widely-used ML models on four public datasets demonstrate 1) the usefulness of FlexiFed; and 2) that compared with the state-of-the-art FL scheme, FlexiFed improves model accuracy by 2.6%-9.7% and accelerates model convergence by 1.24 × -4.04 ×."

The increasingly popular low latency live streaming (LLLS) faces greater challenges since it requires accurate, short-term bandwidth prediction, compared with VOD streaming which needs long-term bandwidth prediction and has good tolerance against prediction error. Part of the challenges comes from the fact that short-term bandwidth experiences both large abrupt changes and uncertain fluctuations. Additionally, it is hard to obtain valid bandwidth measurement samples in LLLS due to its inter-chunk and intra-chunk sending idleness. In this work, we present DeeProphet, a system for accurate bandwidth prediction in LLLS to improve the performance of HAS. DeeProphet overcomes the above challenges by collecting valid measurement samples using fine-grained TCP state information to identify the packet bursting intervals, and by combining the time series model and learning-based model to predict both large change and uncertain fluctuations. Experiment results show that DeeProphet improves the overall QoE by 17.7%-359.2% compared with state-of-the-art LLLS ABR algorithms, and reduces the median bandwidth prediction error to 2.7%."

However, traditional ABR algorithms perform poorly on IPFS because the throughput cannot be estimated correctly. The main problem is that video segments can be retrieved from multiple sources, making it difficult to estimate the throughput. To overcome this issue, we have designed Telescope, an IPFS-aware ABR system. We conduct experiments on the IPFS network, where IPFS video providers are geographically distributed across the globe. Our results show that Telescope significantly improves the Quality of Experience (QoE) of videos, for a diverse set of network and cache conditions, compared to traditional ABR."

In particular, existing empirical studies showed that datacenter traffic typically features much temporal and spatial structure, and that at any given time, some communication pairs interact much more frequently than others. This paper generalizes this study to communication groups and analyzes how clustered the datacenter traffic is, and how stable these clusters are over time. To this end, we propose a methodology which revolves around a biclustering approach, allowing us to identify groups of racks and servers which communicate frequently over the network. In particular, we consider communication patterns occurring in three different Facebook datacenters: a Web cluster consisting of web servers serving web traffic, a Database cluster which mainly consists of MySQL servers, and a Hadoop cluster. Interestingly, we find that in all three clusters, small groups of racks and servers can produce a large fraction of the network traffic, and we can determine these groups even when considering short snapshots of network traffic. We also show empirically that these clusters are fairly stable across time. Our insights on the size and stability of communication clusters hence uncover an interesting potential for resource optimizations in datacenter infrastructures."

Conventional cloud-based DNN training incurs rapidly-increasing data and model transmission overheads as well as privacy issues. Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising solution by facilitating DNN model training on edge servers at the network edge. However, edge servers often suffer from constrained resources and need to collaborate on DNN training. Unfortunately, managed by different telecoms, edge servers cannot properly collaborate with each other without incentives and trust. In this paper, we introduce PipeEdge, a scheme that promotes collaborative edge training between edge servers by introducing incentives and trust based on blockchain. Under the PipeEdge scheme, edge servers can hire trustworthy workers for pipelined DNN training tasks based on model parallelism. We implement PipeEdge and evaluate it comprehensively with four different DNN models. The results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by up to 173.98% with negligible overheads."

To overcome high communication cost and severe privacy concerns of centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to achieve distributed machine learning among networked devices. While the computation and communication limitation has been widely studied, the impact of on-device storage on the performance of FL is still not explored. Without an effective data selection policy to filter the massive streaming data on devices, classical FL can suffer from much longer model training time (4 ×) and significant inference accuracy reduction (7%), observed in our experiments. In this work, we take the first step to consider the online data selection for FL with limited on-device storage. We first define a new data valuation metric for data evaluation and selection in FL with theoretical guarantees for speeding up model convergence and enhancing final model accuracy, simultaneously. We further design ODE, a framework of Online Data sElection for FL, to coordinate networked devices to store valuable data samples. Experimental results on one industrial dataset and three public datasets show the remarkable advantages of ODE over the state-of-the-art approaches. Particularly, on the industrial dataset, ODE achieves as high as 2.5 × speedup of training time and 6% increase in inference accuracy, and is robust to various factors in practical environments."

Existing paradigms of workload forecasting (i.e., edge-only or cloud-only) are improper, due to failing to consider the inter-site correlations and might suffer from significant data transmission delays. With the increasing adoption of edge platforms by web services, it is critical to balance both accuracy and efficiency in workload forecasting. In this paper, we propose ELASTIC, which is the first study that leverages a cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for edge workload forecasting with multi-view graphs. Specifically, at the global stage, we design a learnable aggregation layer on each edge site to reduce the time consumption while capturing the inter-site correlation. Additionally, at the local stage, we design a disaggregation layer combining both the intra-site correlation and inter-site correlation to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on realistic edge workload datasets collected from China’s largest edge service provider show that ELASTIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods, decreases time consumption, and reduces communication cost."

Previous work suggested the use of controllers based on control theory or machine learning to reduce performance degradation under constrained power. However, generating these controllers is challenging as every web service applications running in a data center requires a power-performance model and a fine-tuned controller. In this paper, we present DDPC, a system for autonomic data-driven controller generation for power-latency management. DDPC automates the process of designing and deploying controllers for dynamic power allocation to manage the power-performance trade-offs for latency-sensitive web applications such as a social network. For each application, DDPC uses system identification techniques to learn an adaptive power-performance model that captures the application’s power-latency trade-offs which is then used to generate and deploy a Proportional-Integral (PI) power controller with gain-scheduling to dynamically manage the power allocation to the server running application using RAPL. We evaluate DDPC with two realistic latency-sensitive web applications under varying load scenarios. Our results show that DDPC is capable of autonomically generating and deploying controllers within a few minutes reducing the active power allocation of a web-server by more than 50% compared to state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining the latency well below the target of the application."

It aims to improve the generalization ability of pre-trained models when deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as improving the performance of pre-trained cloud models on smart mobiles. While quite a lot of works have investigated the data distribution shift across clouds and devices, most of them focus on model fine-tuning on personalized data for individual devices to facilitate DMG. Despite their promising, these approaches require on-device re-training, which is practically infeasible due to the overfitting problem and high time delay when performing gradient calculation on real-time data. In this paper, we argue that the computational cost brought by fine-tuning can be rather unnecessary. We consequently present a novel perspective to improving DMG without increasing computational cost, i.e., device-specific parameter generation which directly maps data distribution to parameters. Specifically, we propose an efficient Device-cloUd collaborative parametErs generaTion framework (DUET). DUET is deployed on a powerful cloud server that only requires the low cost of forwarding propagation and low time delay of data transmission between the device and the cloud. By doing so, DUET can rehearse the device-specific model weight realizations conditioned on the personalized real-time data for an individual device. Importantly, our DUET elegantly connects the cloud and device as a “duet” collaboration, frees the DMG from fine-tuning, and enables a faster and more accurate DMG paradigm. We conduct an extensive experimental study of DUET on three public datasets, and the experimental results confirm our framework’s effectiveness and generalisability for different DMG tasks."

One of the most important tasks in traffic is anomaly detection, since abnormal drivers can reduce traffic efficiency and cause safety issues. This work focuses on detecting abnormal driving behaviors from trajectories produced by highway video surveillance systems. Most of the current abnormal driving behavior detection methods focus on a limited category of abnormal behaviors that deal with a single vehicle without considering vehicular interactions. In this work, we consider the problem of detecting a variety of socially abnormal driving behaviors, i.e., behaviors that do not conform to the behavior of other nearby drivers. This task is complicated by the variety of vehicular interactions and the spatial-temporal varying nature of highway traffic. To solve this problem, we propose an autoencoder with a Recurrent Graph Attention Network that can capture the highway driving behaviors contextualized on the surrounding cars, and detect anomalies that deviate from learned patterns. Our model is scalable to large freeways with thousands of cars. Experiments on data generated from traffic simulation software show that our model is the only one that can spot the exact vehicle conducting socially abnormal behaviors, among the state-of-the-art anomaly detection models. We further show the performance on real world HighD traffic dataset, where our model detects vehicles that violate the local driving norms."

Our evaluation, using a full system implementation, shows that BiSR saves 26% of bitrate compared to the traditional H.264 codec and improves the SSIM of video by 3.7% compared to the prior state-of-the-art. Overall, BiSR enhances the user-perceived quality of experience by up to 30.6%."

Given a query node, the conventional approaches rely on the similarity matching with the vectorized node embeddings in the continuous Euclidean space. To efficiently manage intensive similarity computation, developing hashing techniques for graph-structured data has recently become an emerging research direction. Despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space, prior work is however confronted with catastrophic performance decay. In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We propose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach, namely BGCH, which consists of three novel and effective modules: (1) adaptive graph convolutional hashing, (2) latent feature dispersion, and (3) Fourier serialized gradient estimation. Specifically, the former two modules achieve the substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable information loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series decomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more accurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world datasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing hashing-based counterparts, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed model components contained therein."

The interaction-based modeling between the query and the item has been widely validated to be useful for the ranking stage, where more computation cost is affordable. Here, we are quite initerested in an demanding question: how to exploiting query-item interaction-based learning to enhance candidate retrieval and still maintain the low computation cost. Note that an item usually contain various heteorgeneous attributes which could help us understand the item characteristics more precisely. To this end, we propose a novel attribute guided representation learning framework (named AGREE) to enhance the candidate retrieval by exploiting query-attribute relevance. The key idea is to couple the query and item representation learning together during the training phase, but also enable easy decoupling for efficient inference. Specifically, we introduce an attribute fusion layer in the item side to identify most relevant item features for item representation. On the query side, an attribute-aware learning process is introduced to better infer the search intent also from these attributes. After model training, we then decouple the attribute information away from the query encoder, which guarantees the low latency for the inference phase. Extensive experiments over two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AGREE against several state-of-the-art technical alternatives. Further online A/B test from AliPay search servise also show that AGREE achieves substantial performance gain over four business metrics. Currently, the proposed AGREE has been deployed online in AliPay for serving major traffic."

A pre-requisite to discover an entity, e.g. a book, with a search engine is that the entity is retrievable, i.e. there are queries for which the system will surface such entity in the top results. However, machine-learned search engines have a high retrievability bias, where the majority of the queries return the same entities. This happens partly due to the predominance of narrow intent queries, where users create queries using the title of an already known entity, e.g. in book search “harry potter”. The amount of broad queries where users want to discover new entities, e.g. in music search “chill lyrical electronica with an atmospheric feeling to it”, and have a higher tolerance to what they might find, is small in comparison. We focus here on two factors that have a negative impact on the retrievability of the entities (I) the training data used for dense retrieval models and (II) the distribution of narrow and broad intent queries issued in the system. We propose CtrlQGen, a method that generates queries for a chosen underlying intent—narrow or broad. We can use CtrlQGen to improve factor (I) by generating training data for dense retrieval models comprised of diverse synthetic queries. CtrlQGen can also be used to deal with factor (II) by suggesting queries with broader intents to users. Our results on datasets from the domains of music, podcasts, and books reveal that we can significantly decrease the retrievability bias of a dense retrieval model when using CtrlQGen. First, by using the generated queries as training data for dense models we make 9% of the entities retrievable—go from zero to non-zero retrievability. Second, by suggesting broader queries to users, we can make 12% of the entities retrievable in the best case."

However, existing conversational dense retrieval solutions simply fine-tune the pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder on limited conversational search data, which are hard to achieve satisfactory performance in such a complex conversational search scenario. Meanwhile, the learned latent representation also lacks interpretability that people cannot perceive how the model understands the session. To tackle the above drawbacks, we propose a sparse Lexical-based Conversational REtriever (LeCoRE), which extends the SPLADE model with two well-matched multi-level denoising methods uniformly based on knowledge distillation and external query rewrites to generate denoised and interpretable lexical session representation. Extensive experiments on four public conversational search datasets in both normal and zero-shot evaluation settings demonstrate the strong performance of LeCoRE towards more effective and interpretable conversational search."

These retrievers benefit from surging advances in representation learning towards compressive global sequence-level embeddings. However, they are prone to overlook local salient phrases and entity mentions in texts, which usually play pivot roles in first-stage retrieval. To mitigate this weakness, we propose to make a dense retriever align a well-performing lexicon-aware representation model. The alignment is achieved by weakened knowledge distillations to enlighten the retriever via two aspects – 1) a lexicon-augmented contrastive objective to challenge the dense encoder and 2) a pair-wise rank-consistent regularization to make the dense model’s behavior incline to the other. We evaluate our model on three public benchmarks, which shows that with a comparable lexicon-aware retriever as the teacher, our proposed dense one can bring consistent and significant improvements, and even outdo its teacher. In addition, we show our lexicon-aware distillation strategies are compatible with the standard ranker distillation, which can further lift state-of-the-art performance.1"

Under this greedy search scheme, we make a key observation: many distance computations do not influence search updates so that these computations can be approximated without hurting performance. As a result, we propose FINGER, a fast inference method for efficient graph search in AKNNS. FINGER approximates the distance function by estimating angles between neighboring residual vectors. The approximated distance can be used to bypass unnecessary computations for faster searches. Empirically, when it comes to speeding up the inference of HNSW, which is one of the most popular graph-based AKNNS methods, FINGER significantly outperforms existing acceleration approaches and conventional libraries by 20 to 60 across different benchmark datasets."

Several studies have focused on understanding users’ reading behavior in desktop search. Their findings greatly contribute to the design of information retrieval models. However, little is known about how users read a result in mobile search, although search currently happens more frequently in mobile scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a lab-based user study to investigate users’ fine-grained reading behavior patterns in mobile search. We find that users’ reading attention allocation is strongly affected by several behavior biases, such as position and selection biases. Inspired by these findings, we propose a probabilistic generative model, the Passage-level Reading behavior Model (PRM), to model users’ reading behavior in mobile search. The PRM utilizes observable passage-level exposure and viewport duration events to infer users’ unobserved skimming event, reading event, and satisfaction perception during the reading process. Besides fitting the passage-level reading behavior, we utilize the fitted parameters of PRM to estimate the passage-level and document-level relevance. Experimental results show that PRM outperforms existing unsupervised relevance estimation models. PRM has strong interpretability and provides valuable insights into the understanding of how users seek and perceive useful information in mobile search."

A conventional search engine cannot crawl and index at the same pace as the expansion of the Internet. Moreover, a large portion of the data on the Internet is not accessible to traditional search engines. Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) is a viable solution to this as it integrates multiple shards (resources) and provides a unified access to them. Resource selection is a key component of DIR systems. There is a rich body of literature on resource selection approaches for DIR. A key limitation of the existing approaches is that they primarily use term-based statistical features and do not generally model resource-query and resource-resource relationships. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) based approach to learning-to-rank that is capable of modeling resource-query and resource-resource relationships. Specifically, we utilize a pre-trained language model (PTLM) to obtain semantic information from queries and resources. Then, we explicitly build a heterogeneous graph to preserve structural information of query-resource relationships and employ GNN to extract structural information. In addition, the heterogeneous graph is enriched with resource-resource type of edges to further enhance the ranking accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach is highly effective in resource selection.

In fine-grained alignment mode, our method fully utilizes the pre-trained knowledge of the CLIP model to align words with corresponding video frames, and uses the fine-grained information to compute text-video similarity more accurately. In flow-style matching mode, to alleviate the detrimental impact of the hubness problem, we model the retrieval problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and solve it using maximum flow with minimum cost algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on five public text-video datasets. The overall performance of our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we evaluate the computational efficiency of Match4Match. Benefiting from the three flexible inference modes, Match4Match can respond to a large number of query requests with low latency or achieve high recall with acceptable time consumption."

However, deep hashing models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, making it essential to develop adversarial defense methods for image retrieval. Existing solutions achieved limited defense performance because of using weak adversarial samples for training and lacking discriminative optimization objectives to learn robust features. In this paper, we present a min-max based Center-guided Adversarial Training, namely CgAT, to improve the robustness of deep hashing networks through worst adversarial examples. Our key idea is to formulate a hash code (dubbed center code) as a discriminative semantic representation of the original sample, which can be used to guide the generation of the powerful adversarial example and as an accurate optimization objective for adversarial training. Specifically, we first formulate the center code as a semantically-discriminative representative of the input image content, which preserves the semantic similarity with positive samples and dissimilarity with negative examples. We prove that a mathematical formula can calculate the center code immediately. After obtaining the center codes in each optimization iteration of the deep hashing network, they are adopted to guide the adversarial training process. On the one hand, CgAT generates the worst adversarial examples as augmented data by maximizing the Hamming distance between the hash codes of the adversarial examples and the center codes. On the other hand, CgAT learns to mitigate the effects of adversarial samples by minimizing the Hamming distance to the center codes. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial training algorithm in defending against adversarial attacks for deep hashing-based retrieval. Compared with the current state-of-the-art defense method, we significantly improve the defense performance by an average of 18.61%, 12.35%, and 11.56% on FLICKR-25K, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO, respectively.

Ranker A may have this systematic difference (different “vibe”) without having systematically better or worse results according to standard information retrieval metrics. We first show that a vibe difference can exist, comparing two publicly available rankers, where the one that is trained on health-related queries will systematically prefer health-related results, even for non-health queries.

Asking clarifying questions in conversational search has been widely studied and considered an effective solution to resolve query ambiguity. Existing work have explored various approaches for clarifying question ranking and generation. However, due to the lack of real conversational search data, they have to use artificial datasets for training, which limits their generalizability to real-world search scenarios. As a result, the industry has shown reluctance to implement them in reality, further suspending the availability of real conversational search interaction data. The above dilemma can be formulated as a cold start problem of clarifying question generation and conversational search in general. Furthermore, even if we do have large-scale conversational logs, it is not realistic to gather training data that can comprehensively cover all possible queries and topics in open-domain search scenarios. The risk of fitting bias when training a clarifying question retrieval/generation model on incomprehensive dataset is thus another important challenge."

Ideally, we expect the better the teacher is, the better the student performs. However, this expectation does not always come true.

To bridge the gap, we propose PROD, a PROgressive Distillation method, for dense retrieval. PROD consists of a teacher progressive distillation and a data progressive distillation to gradually improve the student. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization term in each distillation process.

Item list continuation is proposed to model the overall trend of a list and predict subsequent items. Recently, Transformer-based models have shown promise in comprehending contextual information and capturing item relationships in a list. However, deploying them in real-time industrial applications is challenging, mainly because the autoregressive generation mechanism used in them is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel fast non-autoregressive sequence generation model, namely FANS, to enhance inference efficiency and quality for item list continuation. First, we use a non-autoregressive generation mechanism to decode next K items simultaneously instead of one by one in existing models. Then, we design a two-stage classifier to replace the vanilla classifier used in current transformer-based models to further reduce the decoding time. Moreover, to improve the quality of non-autoregressive generation, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to optimize training. Experimental results on four real-world item list continuation datasets including Zhihu, Spotify, AotM, and Goodreads show that our FANS model can significantly improve inference efficiency (up to 8.7x) while achieving competitive or better generation quality for item list continuation compared with the state-of-the-art autoregressive models. We also validate the efficiency of FANS in an industrial setting. Our source code and data will be available at MindSpore/models1 and Github2."

Current state-of-the-art approaches generally resolve the problem by integrating pseudo-labeling and domain adaptation techniques into deep hashing paradigms. Nevertheless, they usually suffer from serious class imbalance in pseudo-labels and suboptimal domain alignment caused by the neglection of the intrinsic structures of two domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named unbiaseD duAl hashiNg Contrastive lEarning (DANCE) for domain adaptive image retrieval. The core of our DANCE is to perform contrastive learning on hash codes from both instance level and prototype level. To begin, DANCE utilizes label information to guide instance-level hashing contrastive learning in the source domain. To generate unbiased and reliable pseudo-labels for semantic learning in the target domain, we uniformly select samples around each label embedding in the Hamming space. A momentum-update scheme is also utilized to smooth the optimization process. Additionally, we measure the semantic prototype representations in both source and target domains and incorporate them into a domain-aware prototype-level contrastive learning paradigm, which enhances domain alignment in the Hamming space while maximizing the model capacity. Experimental results on a number of well-known domain adaptive retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed DANCE compared to a variety of competing baselines in different settings."

However, the indexes in vector quantization cannot be trained together with the inference models since data indexing is not differentiable. To this end, differentiable vector quantization approaches, such as DiffPQ and DeepPQ, have been recently proposed, but existing methods have two drawbacks. First, they do not impose any constraints on codebooks, such that the resultant codebooks lack diversity, leading to limited retrieval performance. Second, since data indexing resorts to operator, differentiability is usually achieved by either relaxation or Straight-Through Estimation (STE), which leads to biased gradient and slow convergence. To address these problems, we propose a Differentiable Optimized Product Quantization method (DOPQ) and beyond in this paper. Particularly, each data is projected into multiple orthogonal spaces, to generate multiple views of data. Thus, each codebook is learned with one view of data, guaranteeing the diversity of codebooks. Moreover, instead of simple differentiable relaxation, DOPQ optimizes the loss based on direct loss minimization, significantly reducing the gradient bias problem. Finally, DOPQ is evaluated with seven datasets of both recommendation and image search tasks. Extensive experimental results show that DOPQ outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin."

This paper investigates the effectiveness of such a traversal guidance strategy during top k retrieval when using other models such as SPLADE and uniCOIL, and finds that unconstrained BM25-driven skipping could have a visible relevance degradation when the BM25 model is not well aligned with a learned weight model or when retrieval depth k is small. This paper generalizes the previous work and optimizes the BM25 guided index traversal with a two-level pruning control scheme and model alignment for fast retrieval using a sparse representation. Although there can be a cost of increased latency, the proposed scheme is much faster than the original MaxScore method without BM25 guidance while retaining the relevance effectiveness. This paper analyzes the competitiveness of this two-level pruning scheme, and evaluates its tradeoff in ranking relevance and time efficiency when searching several test datasets."

In classic auction theory, only the auctioneer (i.e., the platform) and buyers (i.e., the advertisers) are involved, while the advertising audiences are ignored. For ecommerce advertising, however, the platform can provide coupons for the advertising audiences and nudge them into purchasing more products at lower prices (e.g., 2 dollars off the regular price). Such promotions can lead to an increase in amount and value of purchases. In this paper, we jointly design the coupon value computation, slot allocation, and payment of online advertising in an auto-bidding world. Firstly, we propose the auction mechanism, named CFA-auction (i.e., Coupon-For-the-Audiences-auction), which takes advertising audiences into account in the auction design. We prove the existence of pacing equilibrium, and show that CFA-auction satisfies the IC (incentive compatibility), IR (individual rationality) constraints. Then, we study the optimality of CFA-auction, and prove it can maintain an approximation of the optimal. Finally, experimental evaluation results on both offline dataset as well as online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CFA-auction."

First, we show a natural reduction from mechanisms in the penalty-bonus task framework to mechanisms in the joint-disjoint task framework that maps every truthful mechanism to an omni-truthful mechanism. Such a reduction is non-trivial as we show that current penalty-bonus task mechanisms are not, in general, omni-truthful. Second, for a stronger truthful guarantee, we design the matching agreement (MA) mechanism which is informed omni-truthful. Finally, for the MA mechanism in the detail-free setting where no prior knowledge is assumed, we show how many tasks are required to (approximately) retain the truthful guarantees."

Such dynamics are important in shaping processes and outcomes in society, from trending items in entertainment, collective knowledge creation, to election outcomes. The outcomes of online cultural markets are susceptible to intricate social influence dynamics, particularly so when the community comprises consumers with heterogeneous interests. This has made formal analysis of these markets improbable. In this paper, we remedy this by establishing robust connections between influence dynamics and optimization processes, in trial-offer markets where the consumer preferences are modelled by multinomial logit. Among other results, we show that the proportional-response-esque influence dynamic is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent on a convex objective function, thus leading to a stable and predictable outcome. When all consumers are homogeneous, the objective function has a natural interpretation as a weighted sum of efficiency and diversity of the culture market. In simulations driven by real-world preferences collected from a large-scale recommender system, we observe that ranking strategies aligned with the underlying heterogeneous preferences are more stable, and achieves higher efficiency and diversity. More broadly, we see this work as the first step in connecting computational methods for classical markets to the problem area of online attention and recommender systems. We hope this result paves the way to posing and answering a diverse set of research questions in this area."

In this work, we propose a contextual multi-armed bandit setting to model the dependency of content providers on exposure. In our model, the system receives a user context in every round and has to select one of the arms. Every arm is a content provider who must receive a minimum number of pulls every fixed time period (e.g., a month) to remain viable in later rounds; otherwise, the arm departs and is no longer available. The system aims to maximize the users’ (content consumers) welfare. To that end, it should learn which arms are vital and ensure they remain viable by subsidizing arm pulls if needed. We develop algorithms with sub-linear regret, as well as a lower bound that demonstrates that our algorithms are optimal up to logarithmic factors."

Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format compared to the classic mCPA format."

For binary feedback, when the noise distribution is (partially) known, we propose a bidding algorithm that achieves at most regret, where Δ is a constant reserve in first price auctions.1 For the full information feedback with unknown noise distribution, we provide an algorithm that achieves regret at most . Our approach combines an estimator for log-concave density functions and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to learn the noise distribution and linear weight α0 simultaneously.

We consider the competitive ratio between the hindsight optimal welfare and the optimal worst-case welfare among all item-pricing mechanisms, when the order of the arriving buyers is adversarial. We assume that buyers own the tie-breaking power, i.e. they can choose whether or not to buy the demand path at 0 utility. We prove a tight competitive ratio of 3/2 when the underlying graph is a single path (also known as the highway problem), whereas item-pricing can achieve the hindsight optimal if the seller is allowed to choose a proper tie-breaking rule to maximize the welfare [6, 11]. Moreover, we prove an O(1) upper bound of competitive ratio when the underlying graph is a tree."

Our controller has a fixed resource budget in each round, and can use this to minimize the effect of demand/supply shocks in the network. We formulate the optimal intervention problem as a Markov Decision Process, and show how we can leverage the problem structure to efficiently compute optimal intervention policies with continuous interventions, and give approximation algorithms in the case of discrete interventions. Going beyond financial networks, we argue that our model captures dynamic network intervention in a much broader class of dynamic demand/supply settings with networked inter-dependencies. To demonstrate this, we apply our intervention algorithms to a wide variety of Web-related application domains, including ridesharing, online transaction platforms, and financial networks with agent mobility; in each case, we study the relationship between node centrality and intervention strength, as well as fairness properties of the optimal interventions."

Most of the existing BFMs concentrate on maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint, which is insufficient for many applications with complex objectives or constraints. Observing this, the recent studies (e.g., [4, 5, 11]) have considered non-monotone submodular objectives or more complex constraints such as a k-system constraint. In this study, we follow this line of research and propose truthful BFMs with improved performance bounds for non-monotone submodular objectives with or without a k-system constraint. Our BFMs leverage the idea of providing random prices to users while deferring the decision on the final winning set, and are also based on a novel randomized algorithm for the canonical constrained submodular maximization problem achieving better performance bounds compared to the state-of-the-art. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated by extensive experiments on several applications about social network marketing, crowdsourcing and personalized recommendation."

The values of subsets often display diminishing returns, and hence, submodular functions have been used to model them. If the inputs defining the submodular function are known, then existing algorithms can be used. In many applications, however, inputs have been observed to have social biases that reduce the utility of the output subset. Hence, interventions to improve the utility are desired. Prior works focus on maximizing linear functions—a special case of submodular functions—and show that fairness constraint-based interventions can not only ensure proportional representation but also achieve near-optimal utility in the presence of biases. We study the maximization of a family of submodular functions that capture functions arising in the aforementioned applications. Our first result is that, unlike linear functions, constraint-based interventions cannot guarantee any constant fraction of the optimal utility for this family of submodular functions. Our second result is an algorithm for submodular maximization. The algorithm provably outputs subsets that have near-optimal utility for this family under mild assumptions and that proportionally represent items from each group. In empirical evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world data, we observe that this algorithm improves the utility of the output subset for this family of submodular functions over baselines."

However, it is unclear to what extent LMs “reuse” a training corpus. For instance, models can generate paraphrased sentences that are contextually similar to training samples. In this work, therefore, we study three types of plagiarism (i.e., verbatim, paraphrase, and idea) among GPT-2 generated texts, in comparison to its training data, and further analyze the plagiarism patterns of fine-tuned LMs with domain-specific corpora which are extensively used in practice. Our results suggest that (1) three types of plagiarism widely exist in LMs beyond memorization, (2) both size and decoding methods of LMs are strongly associated with the degrees of plagiarism they exhibit, and (3) fine-tuned LMs’ plagiarism patterns vary based on their corpus similarity and homogeneity. Given that a majority of LMs’ training data is scraped from the Web without informing content owners, their reiteration of words, phrases, and even core ideas from training sets into generated texts has ethical implications. Their patterns are likely to exacerbate as both the size of LMs and their training data increase, raising concerns about indiscriminately pursuing larger models with larger training corpora. Plagiarized content can also contain individuals’ personal and sensitive information. These findings overall cast doubt on the practicality of current LMs in mission-critical writing tasks and urge more discussions around the observed phenomena.

This environment makes it challenging for practitioners to operationalize and pick metrics that work within their unique context. This suggests that practitioners require more decision-making support, but it is not clear what type of support would be beneficial. We conducted a literature review of 24 papers to gather metrics introduced by the research community for measuring fairness in recommendation and ranking systems. We organized these metrics into a ‘decision-tree style’ support framework designed to help practitioners scope fairness objectives and identify fairness metrics relevant to their recommendation domain and application context. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews using this framework to assess which challenges practitioners may face when scoping fairness objectives and metrics for their system, and which further support may be needed beyond such tools."

Platforms deploy infrastructure to flag or remove automated accounts, but their tools and data are not publicly available. Thus, the public must rely on third-party bot detection. These tools employ machine learning and often achieve near-perfect performance for classification on existing datasets, suggesting bot detection is accurate, reliable and fit for use in downstream applications. We provide evidence that this is not the case and show that high performance is attributable to limitations in dataset collection and labeling rather than sophistication of the tools. Specifically, we show that simple decision rules — shallow decision trees trained on a small number of features — achieve near-state-of-the-art performance on most available datasets and that bot detection datasets, even when combined together, do not generalize well to out-of-sample datasets. Our findings reveal that predictions are highly dependent on each dataset’s collection and labeling procedures rather than fundamental differences between bots and humans.

The proposed method specifies a statistical design, a sampling algorithm, and a technological setup for data collection through web crawling. The statistical design reduces the dimensionality of the problem and ensures that the data collected are representative, variation-rich, and suitable for the investigation of the causes behind any observed disparities. Implementations of the method can collect data on algorithmic decisions, such as price, recommendations, and delivery fees that can be matched to website visitor demographic data from established sources such as censuses and large scale surveys. The combined data can be used to investigate the presence and causes of disparate impact, potentially helping online retailers audit their algorithms without collecting or holding the demographic data of their users. The proposed method is illustrated in the context of the automated pricing decisions of a leading retailer in the United States. A custom-built platform implemented the method to collect data for nearly 20,000 different grocery products at more than 3,000 randomly-selected zip codes. The data collected indicates that prices are higher for locations with high proportions of minority households. Although these price disparities can be partly attributed to algorithmic biases, they are mainly explained by local factors and therefore can be regarded as business necessities."

Among different fairness definitions, path-specific causal fairness is a widely adopted one with great potentials, as it distinguishes the fair and unfair effects that the sensitive attributes exert on algorithm predictions. Existing methods based on path-specific causal fairness either require graph structure as the prior knowledge or have high complexity in the calculation of path-specific effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel casual graph based fair prediction framework which integrates graph structure learning into fair prediction to ensure that unfair pathways are excluded in the causal graph. Furthermore, we generalize the proposed framework to the scenarios where sensitive attributes can be non-root nodes and affected by other variables, which is commonly observed in real-world applications, such as recommendation system, but hardly addressed by existing works. We provide theoretical analysis on the generalization bound for the proposed fair prediction method, and conduct a series of experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate that the proposed framework can provide better prediction performance and algorithm fairness trade-off."

In such settings, trained models can be dominated by the relationships that best fit the majority group, leading to disparate performance. We propose framing toxicity detection as multi-task learning (MTL), allowing a model to specialize on the relationships that are relevant to each demographic group while also leveraging shared properties across groups. With toxicity detection, each task corresponds to identifying toxicity against a particular demographic group. However, traditional MTL requires labels for all tasks to be present for every data point. To address this, we propose Conditional MTL (CondMTL), wherein only training examples relevant to the given demographic group are considered by the loss function. This lets us learn group specific representations in each branch which are not cross contaminated by irrelevant labels. Results on synthetic and real data show that using CondMTL improves predictive recall over various baselines in general and for the minority demographic group in particular, while having similar overall accuracy."

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on designing proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic fairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more stable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF aims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the system to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to recommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in an online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness Re-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates provider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the exposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and the max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show that the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing problem and solved efficiently in its dual space. During the online re-ranking phase, a momentum gradient descent method is designed to conduct the dynamic re-ranking. Theoretical analysis showed that the regret of P-MMF can be bounded. Experimental results on four public recommender datasets demonstrated that P-MMF can outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results also show that P-MMF can retain small computationally costs on a corpus with the large number of items."

The core of ECF is mining taste clusters from user-item interactions and item profiles. We map each user and item to a sparse set of taste clusters, and taste clusters are distinguished by a few representative tags. The user-item preference, users/items’ cluster affiliations, and the generation of taste clusters are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we introduce a forest mechanism to ensure the model’s accuracy, explainability, and diversity. To comprehensively evaluate the explainability quality of taste clusters, we design several quantitative metrics, including in-cluster item coverage, tag utilization, silhouette, and informativeness.

However, the size of different item groups (specified by item attribute) is usually unevenly distributed. We empirically find that the commonly used uniform negative sampling strategy for pairwise algorithms (e.g., BPR) can inherit such data bias and oversample the majority item group as negative instances, severely countering group fairness on the item side. In this paper, we propose a Fairly adaptive Negative sampling approach (FairNeg), which improves item group fairness via adaptively adjusting the group-level negative sampling distribution in the training process. In particular, it first perceives the model’s unfairness status at each step and then adjusts the group-wise sampling distribution with an adaptive momentum update strategy for better facilitating fairness optimization. Moreover, a negative sampling distribution Mixup mechanism is proposed, which gracefully incorporates existing importance-aware sampling techniques intended for mining informative negative samples, thus allowing for achieving multiple optimization purposes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show our proposed method’s superiority in group fairness enhancement and fairness-utility tradeoff."

Lately, multi-modal hateful content such as memes has drawn relatively more traction than uni-modal content. Moreover, the availability of implicit content payloads makes them fairly challenging to be detected by existing hateful meme detection systems. In this paper, we present a use case study to analyze such systems’ vulnerabilities against external adversarial attacks. We find that even very simple perturbations in uni-modal and multi-modal settings performed by humans with little knowledge about the model can make the existing detection models highly vulnerable. Empirically, we find a noticeable performance drop of as high as 10% in the macro-F1 score for certain attacks. As a remedy, we attempt to boost the model’s robustness using contrastive learning as well as an adversarial training-based method - VILLA. Using an ensemble of the above two approaches, in two of our high resolution datasets, we are able to (re)gain back the performance to a large extent for certain attacks. We believe that ours is a first step toward addressing this crucial problem in an adversarial setting and would inspire more such investigations in the future."

Due to the increasing popularity of this business model, thousands of small producers and re-sellers are starting to depend on these platforms for their livelihood; thus, it is important to provide fair earning opportunities to them. The enormous product space in such platforms prohibits manual search, and motivates the need for recommendation algorithms to effectively allocate product exposure and, consequently, earning opportunities. In this work, we focus on the fairness of such allocations in social commerce platforms and formulate the problem of assigning products to re-sellers as a fair division problem with indivisible items under two-sided cardinality constraints, wherein each product must be given to at least a certain number of re-sellers and each re-seller must get a certain number of products."

The vast majority of existing work considers the fairness measure in terms of the low-order connectivity patterns (e.g., edges), while overlooking the higher-order patterns (e.g., k-cliques) and the dynamic nature of real-world graphs. For example, preserving triangles from graph cuts during clustering is the key to detecting compact communities; however, if the clustering algorithm only pays attention to triangle-based compactness, then the returned communities lose the fairness guarantee for each group in the graph. Furthermore, in practice, when the graph (e.g., social networks) topology constantly changes over time, one natural question is how can we ensure the compactness and demographic parity at each timestamp efficiently. To address these problems, we start from the static setting and propose a spectral method that preserves clique connections and incorporates demographic fairness constraints in returned clusters at the same time. To make this static method fit for the dynamic setting, we propose two core techniques, Laplacian Update via Edge Filtering and Searching and Eigen-Pairs Update with Singularity Avoided. Finally, all proposed components are combined into an end-to-end clustering framework named F-SEGA, and we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of F-SEGA."

Our model uses contrastive loss to generate embeddings that are indistinguishable for each protected group, while forcing the embeddings of counterfactual pairs to be similar.

This study is an initial step towards understanding whether and how multiple parameters such as cognitive skills, mood, personality, alertness, comprehension skill, and social and physical context of workers can be leveraged in tandem to improve worker performance estimations in heterogeneous micro tasks. Our predictive models indicate that these parameters have varying effects on worker performance in the five task types considered – sentiment analysis, classification, transcription, named entity recognition and bounding box. Moreover, we note 0.003 - 0.018 reduction in mean absolute error of predicted worker accuracy across all tasks, when task assignment is based on models that consider all parameters vs. models that only consider workers’ cognitive skills.

Classic wisdom of crowds theory is based on evidence gathered from studying large groups of diverse and independent decision-makers. Yet, most human decisions are reached in online settings of interconnected like-minded people that challenge these criteria. This observation raises a key question: Are there surprising expressions of collective intelligence online? Here, we explore whether crowds furnish collective intelligence benefits in crowdfunding systems. Crowdfunding has grown and diversified quickly over the past decade, expanding from funding aspirant creative works and supplying pro-social donations to enabling large citizen-funded urban projects and providing commercial interest-based unsecured loans. Using nearly 10 million loan contributions from a market-dominant lending platform, we find evidence for collective intelligence indicators in crowdfunding. Our results, which are based on a two-stage Heckman selection model, indicate that opinion diversity and the speed at which funds are contributed predict who gets funded and who repays, even after accounting for traditional measures of creditworthiness. Moreover, crowds work consistently well in correctly assessing the outcome of high-risk projects. Finally, diversity and speed serve as early warning signals when inferring fundraising based solely on the initial part of the campaign. Our findings broaden the field of crowd-aware system design and inform discussions about the augmentation of traditional financing systems with tech innovations."

For example, these reviewers may aim to get assigned to a friend’s paper as part of a quid-pro-quo deal. A critical impediment towards creating and evaluating methods to mitigate this issue is the lack of any publicly-available data on malicious paper bidding.

Triplet similarity comparison is a type of crowdsourcing task, in which crowd workers are asked the question “among three given objects, which two are more similar?”, which is relatively easy for humans to answer. However, the comparison can be sometimes based on multiple views, i.e., different independent attributes such as color and shape. Each view may lead to different results for the same three objects. Although an algorithm was proposed in prior work to produce multiview embeddings, it involves at least two problems: (1) the existing algorithm cannot independently predict multiview embeddings for a new sample, and (2) different people may prefer different views. In this study, we propose an end-to-end inductive deep learning framework to solve the multiview representation learning problem. The results show that our proposed method can obtain multiview embeddings of any object, in which each view corresponds to an independent attribute of the object. We collected two datasets from a crowdsourcing platform to experimentally investigate the performance of our proposed approach compared to conventional baseline methods."

Harmful memes can range from spreading hate speech promoting violence, and causing emotional distress to individuals or communities. These memes are often designed to be misleading, manipulative, and controversial, making it challenging to detect and remove them from online platforms. Previous studies focused on how to fuse visual and language modalities to capture contextual information. However, meme analysis still severely suffers from data deficiency, resulting in insufficient learning of fusion modules. Further, using conventional pretrained encoders for text and images exhibits a greater semantic gap in feature spaces and leads to low performance. To address these gaps, this paper reformulates a harmful meme analysis as an auto-filling and presents a prompt-based approach to identify harmful memes. Specifically, we first transform multimodal data to a single (i.e., textual) modality by generating the captions and attributes of the visual data and then prepend the textual data in the prompt-based pre-trained language model. Experimental results on two benchmark harmful memes datasets demonstrate that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods. We conclude with the transferability and robustness of our approach to identify creative harmful memes."

By leveraging a cognitive model of tonal harmony, chord progressions are segmented into meaningful structures, and patterns emerge from their comparison via harmonic similarity. Akin to a music memory, the KG holds temporal connections between consecutive patterns, as well as salient similarity relationships. After demonstrating the validity of our choices, we provide examples of how this design enables novel pathways for combinational creativity. The memory provides a fully accountable and explainable framework to inspire and support creative professionals – allowing for the discovery of progressions consistent with given criteria, the recomposition of harmonic sections, but also the co-creation of new progressions."

To address this problem, we propose a multimodal fusion approach, named Scene-Adapt Fusion (SA-Fusion), which can fully utilize the complementarity of RGB and depth modalities in web-based HCI tasks. SA-Fusion can be applied in existing hand detection and 3D hand pose estimation frameworks to boost their performance, and can be further integrated into the prototyping AR system to construct a web-based interactive AR application for unconstrained environments.

Despite the plenty of efforts to improve the generative models, there is limited work on understanding the information needs of the users of these systems at scale. We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of large-scale prompt logs collected from multiple text-to-image generation systems. Our work is analogous to analyzing the query logs of Web search engines, a line of work that has made critical contributions to the glory of the Web search industry and research. Compared with Web search queries, text-to-image prompts are significantly longer, often organized into special structures that consist of the subject, form, and intent of the generation tasks and present unique categories of information needs. Users make more edits within creation sessions, which present remarkable exploratory patterns. There is also a considerable gap between the user-input prompts and the captions of the images included in the open training data of the generative models.

They have widespread applications in scientific innovation, creative writing, and education. The ability to discover creative analogies that are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the web is highly desirable to power all such applications dynamically and augment human creativity. Recently, Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), trained on massive Web data, have shown great promise in generating mostly known analogies that are explicitly mentioned on the Web. However, it is unclear how they could be leveraged for mining creative analogies not explicitly mentioned on the Web. We address this challenge and propose Creative Analogy Mining (CAM), a novel framework for mining creative analogies, which consists of the following three main steps: 1) Generate analogies using PLMs with effectively designed prompts, 2) Evaluate their quality using scoring functions, and 3) Refine the low-quality analogies by another round of prompt-based generation. We propose both unsupervised and supervised instantiations of the framework so that it can be used even without any annotated data. Based on human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we find that our unsupervised framework can mine 13.7% highly-creative and 56.37% somewhat-creative analogies. Moreover, our supervised scores are generally better than the unsupervised ones and correlate moderately with human evaluators, indicating that they would be even more effective at mining creative analogies. These findings also shed light on the creativity of PLMs 1."

Thus the NLP health mention classification (HMC) task aims to identify posts where users are discussing health conditions literally, not figuratively. Existing computational research typically only studies health mentions within well-represented groups in developed nations. Developing countries with limited health surveillance abilities fail to benefit from such data to manage public health crises. To advance the HMC research and benefit more diverse populations, we present the Nairaland health mention dataset (NHMD), a new dataset collected from a dedicated web forum for Nigerians. NHMD consists of 7,763 manually labelled posts extracted based on four prevalent diseases (HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Stroke and Tuberculosis) in Nigeria. With NHMD, we conduct extensive experiments using current state-of-the-art models for HMC and identify that, compared to existing public datasets, NHMD contains out-of-distribution examples. Hence, it is well suited for domain adaptation studies. The introduction of the NHMD dataset imposes better diversity coverage of vulnerable populations and generalisation for HMC tasks in a global public health surveillance setting. Additionally, we present a novel multi-task learning approach for HMC tasks by combining literal word meaning prediction as an auxiliary task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods statistically significantly (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon test) in terms of F1 score over the state-of-the-art and shows that our new dataset poses a strong challenge to the existing HMC methods."

Given a set of users, a set of existing facilities, and a set of potential sites, we decide which of the existing facilities to relocate to potential sites, such that two factors are satisfied: (1) facility exposure: facilities after relocation have balanced exposure, namely serving equivalent numbers of users; (2) user convenience: it is convenient for users to access the nearest facility, which provides services with shorter travel distance. This problem is motivated by applications such as dynamically redistributing vaccine resources to align supply with demand for different vaccination centers, and relocating the bike sharing sites daily to improve the transportation efficiency. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard, and then we propose two algorithms: a non-learning best response algorithm () and a reinforcement learning algorithm (). In particular, the best response algorithm finds a Nash equilibrium to balance the facility-related and the user-related goals. To avoid being confined to only one Nash equilibrium, as found in the method, we also propose the reinforcement learning algorithm for long-term benefits, where each facility is an agent and we determine whether a facility needs to be relocated or not. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we adopt multiple metrics to evaluate not only our objective, but also several other facility exposure equity and user convenience metrics to understand the benefits after facility relocation. Finally, comprehensive experiments using real-world datasets provide insights into the effectiveness of the two algorithms in practice."

Climate change is threatening the health of the planet and humanity. Public engagement is critical to address climate change. However, climate change conversations on Twitter tend to polarize beliefs, leading to misinformation and fake news that influence public attitudes, often dividing them into climate change believers and deniers. Our paper proposes an approach to classify the attitude of climate change tweets (believe/deny/ambiguous) to identify denier statements on Twitter. Most existing approaches for detecting stances and classifying climate change tweets either overlook deniers’ tweets or do not have a suitable architecture. The relevant literature suggests that emotions and higher levels of toxicity are prevalent in climate change Twitter conversations, leading to a delay in appropriate climate action. Therefore, our work focuses on learning stance detection (main task) while exploiting the auxiliary tasks of recognizing emotions and offensive utterances. We propose a multimodal multitasking framework MEMOCLiC that captures the input data using different embedding techniques and attention frameworks, and then incorporates the learned emotional and offensive expressions to obtain an overall representation of the features relevant to the stance of the input tweet. Extensive experiments conducted on a novel curated climate change dataset and two benchmark stance detection datasets (SemEval-2016 and ClimateStance-2022) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Time-critical analysis of crisis data can help human organizations gain actionable information and plan for aid responses. Many existing studies have proposed methods to identify informative messages and categorize them into different humanitarian classes. Advanced neural network architectures tend to achieve state-of-the-art performance, but the model decisions are opaque. While attention heatmaps show insights into the model’s prediction, some studies found that standard attention does not provide meaningful explanations. Alternatively, recent works proposed interpretable approaches for the classification of crisis events that rely on human rationales to train and extract short snippets as explanations. However, the rationale annotations are not always available, especially in real-time situations for new tasks and events. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to learn the rationales under minimal human supervision and derive faithful machine attention. Extensive experiments over four crisis events show that our model is able to obtain better or comparable classification performance (∼ 86% Macro-F1) to baselines and faithful attention heatmaps using only 40-50% human-level supervision. Further, we employ a zero-shot learning setup to detect actionable tweets along with actionable word snippets as rationales."

Concerns are growing about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of infected individuals, who are more likely to experience depression, which can have long-lasting consequences for both the affected individuals and the world. Detection and intervention at an early stage can reduce the risk of depression in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between COVID-19 infection and depression through social media analysis. Firstly, we managed a dataset of COVID-19 patients that contains information about their social media activity both before and after infection. Secondly, We conducted an extensive analysis of this dataset to investigate the characteristic of COVID-19 patients with a higher risk of depression. Thirdly, we proposed a deep neural network for early prediction of depression risk. This model considers daily mood swings as a psychiatric signal and incorporates textual and emotional characteristics via knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in detecting depression risk, with an AUROC of 0.9317 and an AUPRC of 0.8116. Our model has the potential to enable public health organizations to initiate prompt intervention with high-risk patients."

With the increasing popularity of news consumption on various social media platforms, there has been a surge of misinformation which includes false information or unfounded claims. As various text- and social context-based fake news detectors are proposed to detect misinformation on social media, recent works start to focus on the vulnerabilities of fake news detectors. In this paper, we present the first adversarial attack framework against Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors to probe their robustness. Specifically, we leverage a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to simulate the adversarial behavior of fraudsters on social media. Research has shown that in real-world settings, fraudsters coordinate with each other to share different news in order to evade the detection of fake news detectors. Therefore, we modeled our MARL framework as a Markov Game with bot, cyborg, and crowd worker agents, which have their own distinctive cost, budget, and influence. We then use deep Q-learning to search for the optimal policy that maximizes the rewards. Extensive experimental results on two real-world fake news propagation datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively sabotage the GNN-based fake news detector performance. We hope this paper can provide insights for future research on fake news detection."

It has become one of the most focused topics to improve health services for data-scarce hospitals and promote health equity through knowledge sharing among medical institutions. Because electronic medical records (EMRs) contain sensitive personal information, privacy protection is unavoidable and essential for multi-hospital collaboration. In this paper, for a common disease in ICU patients, sepsis, we propose a novel cross-center collaborative learning framework guided by medical knowledge, SofaNet, to achieve early recognition of this disease. The Sepsis-3 guideline, published in 2016, defines that sepsis can be diagnosed by satisfying both suspicion of infection and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) greater than or equal to 2. Based on this knowledge, SofaNet adopts a multi-channel GRU structure to predict SOFA values of different systems, which can be seen as an auxiliary task to generate better health status representations for sepsis recognition. Moreover, we only achieve feature distribution alignment in the hidden space during cross-center collaborative learning, which ensures secure and compliant knowledge transfer without raw data exchange. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets, MIMIC-III and Challenge, demonstrate that SofaNet can benefit early sepsis recognition when hospitals only have limited EMRs."

In this paper, we study a critical type of online misinformation, namely fauxtography, where the image and associated text of a social media post jointly convey a questionable or false sense. In particular, we focus on a sparse semi-supervised fauxtography detection problem, which aims to accurately identify fauxtography by only using the sparsely annotated ground truth labels of social media posts. Our problem is motivated by the key limitation of current fauxtography detection approaches that often require a large amount of expensive and inefficient manual annotations to train an effective fauxtography detection model. We identify two key technical challenges in solving the problem: 1) it is non-trivial to train an accurate detection model given the sparse fauxtography annotations, and 2) it is difficult to extract the heterogeneous and complicated fauxtography features from the multi-modal social media posts for accurate fauxtography detection. To address the above challenges, we propose ContrastFaux, a multi-view contrastive learning framework that jointly explores the sparse fauxtography annotations and the cross-modal fauxtography feature similarity between the image and text in multi-modal posts to accurately detect fauxtography on social media. Evaluation results on two social media datasets demonstrate that ContrastFaux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and semi-supervised learning fauxtography detection baselines by achieving the highest fauxtography detection accuracy."

Estimating the embodied carbon in products is a key step towards understanding their impact, and undertaking mitigation actions. Precise carbon attribution is challenging at scale, requiring both domain expertise and granular supply chain data. As a first-order approximation, standard reports use Economic Input-Output based Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) which estimates carbon emissions per dollar at an industry sector level using transactions between different parts of the economy. EIO-LCA models map products to an industry sector, and uses the corresponding carbon per dollar estimates to calculate the embodied carbon footprint of a product. An LCA expert needs to map each product to one of upwards of 1000 potential industry sectors. To reduce the annotation burden, the standard practice is to group products by categories, and map categories to their corresponding industry sector. We present CaML, an algorithm to automate EIO-LCA using semantic text similarity matching by leveraging the text descriptions of the product and the industry sector. CaML uses a pre-trained sentence transformer model to rank the top-5 matches, and asks a human to check if any of them are a good match. We annotated 40K products with non-experts. Our results reveal that pre-defined product categories are heterogeneous with respect to EIO-LCA industry sectors, and lead to a large mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 51% in kgCO2e/$. CaML outperforms the previous manually intensive method, yielding a MAPE of 22% with no domain labels (zero-shot). We compared annotations of a small sample of 210 products with LCA experts, and find that CaML accuracy is comparable to that of annotations by non-experts."

In this paper, we address these limitations by compiling CW-CURE, a novel dataset of CURE tweets, namely tweets containing claims on prevention, diagnoses, risks, treatments, and cures of medical conditions. CW-CURE contains tweets on four major health conditions, namely, Alzheimer’s disease, Cancer, Diabetes, and Depression annotated for claims, their “checkworthiness\", as well as the different types of claims such as quantitative claim, correlation/causation, personal experience, and future prediction.

In particular, we harness claim-type information obtained with zero-shot learning to show significant improvements in checkworthiness identification.

Here, we propose a pipeline of machine learning models to infer the mean and standard deviation of wealth across multiple geographically clustered populated places, and illustrate their performance in Sierra Leone and Uganda. These models leverage seven independent and freely available feature sources based on satellite images, and metadata collected via online crowd-sourcing and social media. Our models show that combined metadata features are the best predictors of wealth in rural areas, outperforming image-based models, which are the best for predicting the highest wealth quintiles. Our results recover the local mean and variation of wealth, and correctly capture the positive yet non-monotonous correlation between them. We further demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of model transfer across countries and the effects of data recency and other biases.

Recommender systems deploy machine learning models to learn users’ preferences from collected historical data, leading to more centralized recommendation results due to the feedback loop. As a result, it will harm the ranking of content outside the narrowed scope and limit the options seen by users. In this work, we first conduct data analysis from a graph view to observe that the users’ feedback is restricted to limited items, verifying the phenomenon of centralized recommendation. We further develop a general simulation framework to derive the procedure of the recommender system, including data collection, model learning, and item exposure, which forms a loop. To address the filter bubble issue under the feedback loop, we then propose a general and easy-to-use reinforcement learning-based method, which can adaptively select few but effective connections between nodes from different communities as the exposure list. We conduct extensive experiments in the simulation framework based on large-scale real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed reinforcement learning-based control method can serve as an effective solution to alleviate the filter bubble and the separated communities induced by it. We believe the proposed framework of controllable recommendation in this work can inspire not only the researchers of recommender systems, but also a broader community concerned with artificial intelligence algorithms’ impact on humanity, especially for those vulnerable populations on the Web."

How all that affected our mental well-being, especially the ones’ who were already in distress? To investigate the matter we analyse the online discussions on Sanctioned Suicide, a forum where users discuss suicide-related topics freely. We collected discussions starting from March 2018 (before pandemic) up to July 2022, for a total of 53K threads with 700K comments and 16K users. We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the discussions in the forum. The data show that covid, while being present in the discussions, especially during the first lockdown, has not been the main reason why new users registered to the forum. However, covid appears to be indirectly connected to other causes of distress for the users, i.e. anxiety for the economy."

                        "abstract": "Social media platforms provide rich data sources in several domains. In mental health, individuals experiencing an Eating Disorder (ED) are often hesitant to seek help through conventional healthcare services. However, many people seek help with diet and body image issues on social media. To better distinguish at-risk users who may need help for an ED from those who are simply commenting on ED in social environments, highly sophisticated approaches are required. Assessment of ED risks in such a situation can be done in various ways, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Hence, there is a need for and potential benefit of a more complex multimodal approach. To this end, we collect historical tweets, user biographies, and online behaviours of relevant users from Twitter, and generate a reasonably large labelled benchmark dataset. Thereafter, we develop an advanced multimodal deep learning model called EDNet using these data to identify the different types of users with ED engagement (e.g., potential ED sufferers, healthcare professionals, or communicators) and distinguish them from those not experiencing EDs on Twitter. EDNet consists of five deep neural network layers. With the help of its embedding, representation and behaviour modeling layers, it effectively learns the multimodalities of social media. In our experiments, EDNet consistently outperforms all the baseline techniques by significant margins. It achieves an accuracy of up to 94.32% and F1 score of up to 93.91% F1 score. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study to propose a multimodal approach for user-level classification according to their engagement with ED content on social media."

Among existing learning-based approaches, the association between drug substructures (i.e., a sub-graph of the molecule that contributes to certain chemical effect) and the target disease is largely overlooked, though the function of drugs in fact exhibits strong relevance with particular substructures. To address this issue, we propose a molecular substructure-aware encoding method entitled MoleRec that entails a hierarchical architecture aimed at modeling inter-substructure interactions and individual substructures’ impact on patient’s health condition, in order to identify those substructures that really contribute to healing patients. Specifically, MoleRec learns to attentively pooling over substructure representations which will be element-wisely re-scaled by the model’s inferred relevancy with a patient’s health condition to obtain a prior-knowledge-informed drug representation. We further design a weight annealing strategy for drug-drug-interaction (DDI) objective to adaptively control the balance between accuracy and safety criteria throughout training. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. four accuracy and safety metrics.

The order in which posts, videos, messages, comments, ads, used products, notifications are presented to a user greatly affects the time spent on the platform, how often they visit it, how much they interact with each other, and the quantity and quality of the content they post. To this end, item ranking algorithms use models that predict the likelihood of different events, e.g., the user liking, sharing, commenting on a video, clicking/converting on an ad, or opening the platform’s app from a notification. Unfortunately, by solely relying on such event-prediction models, social media platforms tend to over optimize for short-term objectives and ignore the long-term effects. In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at improving item ranking long-term impact. The approach primarily relies on an ML model that predicts negative user experiences. The model utilizes all available UI events: the details of an action can reveal how positive or negative the user experience has been; for example, a user writing a lengthy report asking for a given video to be taken down, likely had a very negative experience. Furthermore, the model takes into account detected integrity (e.g., hostile speech or graphic violence) and quality (e.g., click or engagement bait) issues with the content. Note that those issues can be perceived very differently from different users. Therefore, developing a personalized model, where a prediction refers to a specific user for a specific piece of content at a specific point in time, is a fundamental design choice in our approach. Besides the personalized ML model, our approach consists of two more pieces: (a) the way the personalized model is integrated with an item ranking algorithm and (b) the metrics, methodology, and success criteria for the long term impact of detecting and limiting negative user experiences. Our evaluation process uses extensive A/B testing on the Facebook platform: we compare the impact of our approach in treatment groups against production control groups. The AB test results indicate a 5% to 50% reduction in hides, reports, and submitted feedback. Furthermore, we compare against a baseline that does not include some of the crucial elements of our approach: the comparison shows our approach has a 100x to 30x lower False Positive Ratio than a baseline. Lastly, we present the results from a large scale survey, where we observe a statistically significant improvement of 3 to 6 percent in users’ sentiment regarding content suffering from nudity, clickbait, false / misleading, witnessing-hate, and violence issues."

However, the lengthy nature of social media sessions challenges the applicability and performance of session-based cyberbullying detection models. This is especially true when one aims to use state-of-the-art Transformer-based pre-trained language models, which only take inputs of a limited length. In this paper, we address this limitation of transformer models by proposing a conceptually intuitive framework called LS-CB, which enables cyberbullying detection from lengthy social media sessions. LS-CB relies on the intuition that we can effectively aggregate the predictions made by transformer models on smaller sliding windows extracted from lengthy social media sessions, leading to an overall improved performance. Our extensive experiments with six transformer models on two session-based datasets show that LS-CB consistently outperforms three types of competitive baselines including state-of-the-art cyberbullying detection models. In addition, we conduct a set of qualitative analyses to validate the hypotheses that cyberbullying incidents can be detected through aggregated analysis of smaller chunks derived from lengthy social media sessions (H1), and that cyberbullying incidents can occur at different points of the session (H2), hence positing that frequently used text truncation strategies are suboptimal compared to relying on holistic views of sessions. Our research in turn opens an avenue for fine-grained cyberbullying detection within sessions in future work."

While disaster management efforts were taken, crisis responders struggled to understand the country-wide flood extent, population exposure, urgent needs of affected people, and various types of damage. To tackle this challenge, we leverage remote and social sensing with geospatial data using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for text and image processing. Our satellite-based analysis over a one-month period (25 Aug–25 Sep) revealed that 11.48% of Pakistan was inundated. When combined with geospatial data, this meant 18.9 million people were at risk across 160 districts in Pakistan, with adults constituting 50% of the exposed population. Our social sensing data analysis surfaced 106.7k reports pertaining to deaths, injuries, and concerns of the affected people. To understand the urgent needs of the affected population, we analyzed tweet texts and found that South Karachi, Chitral and North Waziristan required the most basic necessities like food and shelter. Further analysis of tweet images revealed that Lasbela, Rajanpur, and Jhal Magsi had the highest damage reports normalized by their population. These damage reports were found to correlate strongly with affected people reports and need reports, achieving an R-Square of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively.

Here, we analysed more than 500,000 public posts and comments from Facebook Pages dedicated to the topic of vaccination to study the role of moral values and, in particular, the understudied role of the Liberty moral foundation from the actual user-generated text. We operationalise morality by employing the Moral Foundations Theory, while our proposed framework is based on recurrent neural network classifiers with a short memory and entity linking information. Our findings show that the principal moral narratives around the vaccination debate focus on the values of Liberty, Care, and Authority. Vaccine advocates urge compliance with the authorities as prosocial behaviour to protect society. On the other hand, vaccine sceptics mainly build their narrative around the value of Liberty, advocating for the right to choose freely whether to adhere or not to the vaccination. We contribute to the automatic understanding of vaccine hesitancy drivers emerging from user-generated text, providing concrete insights into the moral framing around vaccination decision-making. Especially in emergencies such as the Covid-19 pandemic, contrary to traditional surveys, these insights can be provided contemporary to the event, helping policymakers craft communication campaigns that adequately address the concerns of the hesitant population."

In this study we examine athletes on Cameo, a website that enables bi-directional fan-celebrity interactions, questioning whether the well-documented gender pay gaps in sports persist in this digital setting. Traditional studies into gender pay gaps in sports are mostly in a centralized setting where an organization decides the pay for the players, while Cameo facilitates grass-roots fan engagement where fans pay for video messages from their preferred athletes. The results showed that even on such a platform gender pay gaps persist, both in terms of cost-per-message, and in the number of requests, proxied by number of ratings. For instance, we find that female athletes have a median pay of 30$ per-video, while the same statistic is 40$ for men. The results also contribute to the study of parasocial relationships and personalized fan engagements over a distance. Something that has become more relevant during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where in-person fan engagement has often been limited."

Especially, recent studies turn to self-supervised contrastive learning with manually designed similarity metrics for urban imagery representation learning and further socioeconomic prediction, which however suffers from effectiveness and robustness issues. To address such issues, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge-infused Contrastive Learning (KnowCL) model for urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction. Specifically, we firstly introduce knowledge graph (KG) to effectively model the urban knowledge in spatiality, mobility, etc., and then build neural network based encoders to learn representations of an urban image in associated semantic and visual spaces, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modality based contrastive learning framework with a novel image-KG contrastive loss, which maximizes the mutual information between semantic and visual representations for knowledge infusion. Extensive experiments of applying the learnt visual representations for socioeconomic prediction on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KnowCL with over 30% improvements on R2 compared with baselines. Especially, our proposed KnowCL model can apply to both satellite and street imagery with both effectiveness and transferability achieved, which provides insights into urban imagery-based socioeconomic prediction."

Subsequently, we explore knowledge graph completion approaches for maintaining and updating the graph. Specifically, we manually identify a set of domain-specific UMLS concepts and use them to extract a graph of approximately 75,000 semantic triples from the Semantic MEDLINE database (which contains head-relation-tail triples extracted from PubMed). Using the resulting knowledge graph, we experiment with the KG-BERT approach for graph completion by employing pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa models and also models fine-tuned on a collection of water quality and health risks abstracts retrieved from the Web of Science.

While previous research has analyzed the virality across true and false social media posts, not every misleading post is necessarily equally viral. Rather, misinformation has different characteristics and varies in terms of its believability and harmfulness – which might influence its spread. In this work, we study how the perceived believability and harmfulness of misleading posts are associated with their virality on social media. Specifically, we analyze (and validate) a large sample of crowd-annotated social media posts from Twitter’s Birdwatch platform, on which users can rate the believability and harmfulness of misleading tweets. To address our research questions, we implement an explanatory regression model and link the crowd ratings for believability and harmfulness to the virality of misleading posts on Twitter. Our findings imply that misinformation that is (i) easily believable and (ii) not particularly harmful is associated with more viral resharing cascades. These results offer insights into how different kinds of crowd fact-checked misinformation spreads and suggest that the most viral misleading posts are often not the ones that are particularly concerning from the perspective of public safety. From a practical view, our findings may help platforms to develop more effective strategies to curb the proliferation of misleading posts on social media."

Recent studies have applied multiple types of deep neural networks to solve the KT problem. However, there are two important factors in real-world educational data that are not well represented. First, most existing works augment input representations with the co-occurrence matrix of questions and knowledge components1 (KCs) but fail to explicitly integrate such intrinsic relations into the final response prediction task. Second, the individualized historical performance of students has not been well captured. In this paper, we proposed AT-DKT to improve the prediction performance of the original deep knowledge tracing model with two auxiliary learning tasks, i.e., question tagging (QT) prediction task and individualized prior knowledge (IK) prediction task. Specifically, the QT task helps learn better question representations by predicting whether questions contain specific KCs. The IK task captures students’ global historical performance by progressively predicting student-level prior knowledge that is hidden in students’ historical learning interactions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world educational datasets and compare the proposed approach to both deep sequential KT models and non-sequential models. Experimental results show that AT-DKT outperforms all sequential models with more than 0.9% improvements of AUC for all datasets, and is almost the second best compared to non-sequential models. Furthermore, we conduct both ablation studies and quantitative analysis to show the effectiveness of auxiliary tasks and the superior prediction outcomes of AT-DKT.

With this observation, we propose a Risk-balanced Deep Portfolio Constructor (RDPC) that takes risk into explicit consideration. RDPC is an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based transformer trained to optimize both returns and risk, with a hard attention mechanism that learns the relationship between asset pairs, imitating the powerful pairs trading strategy widely adopted by many investors. Experiments on real-world data show that RDPC achieves state-of-the-art performance not just on risk metrics such as maximum drawdown, but also on risk-adjusted returns metrics including Sharpe ratio and Calmar ratio."

However, learning low-dimensional graph-level representations for dynamic networks is critical for various downstream graph retrieval tasks such as temporal graph similarity ranking, temporal graph isomorphism, and anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a novel method for temporal graph-level embedding that addresses this gap. Our approach involves constructing a multilayer graph and using a modified random walk with temporal backtracking to generate temporal contexts for the graph’s nodes. We then train a “document-level’’ language model on these contexts to generate graph-level embeddings. We evaluate our proposed model on five publicly available datasets for the task of temporal graph similarity ranking, and our model outperforms baseline methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating graph-level embeddings for dynamic networks."

To address this new learning task, we first decompose each HTML document in the corpus into a sequence of smaller HTML fragments where each fragment may consist of a set of HTML entities such as buttons, images, textual content (titles, paragraphs) and stylistic entities such as background-style, font-style, button-style, among others. From these HTML fragments, we then derive a single large heterogeneous hypergraph that captures the higher-order dependencies between HTML fragments and entities in such fragments, both within the same HTML document as well as across the HTML documents in the corpus. We then formulate this new HTML style recommendation task as a hypergraph representation learning problem and propose an approach to solve it. Our approach is able to learn effective low-dimensional representations of the higher-order fragments that consist of sets of heterogeneous entities as well as low-dimensional representations of the individual entities themselves. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach across several design style recommendation tasks.

The results indicate that the ϵ -graph time-series representation effectively captures the structural properties of the graphs across time whereas the commonly used τ -graph time-series representation captures the frequency of edges and temporal patterns with respect to their arrival in the application time.

While anecdotal evidence suggests common topics and trends in these scams, the empirical evidence is limited. Observing that large universities are uniquely positioned to gather and share information about email scams, we built a corpus of 5,155 English language scam emails scraped from information security websites of five large universities in the United States. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling to assess the landscape and trends of scam emails sent to university addresses. We examine themes chronologically and observe that topics vary over time, indicating changes in scammer strategies. For example, scams targeting students with disabilities have steadily risen in popularity since they first appeared in 2015, while password scams experienced a boom in 2016 but have lessened in recent years. To encourage further research to mitigate the threat of email scams, we release this corpus for others to study."

The model leverages a hard parameter-sharing framework and consists of a shared multi-stack encoder with multi-head self-attention and two fully connected task heads. It is trained to achieve two multi-class classification tasks: predicting product churn and identifying the next-best products (NBP) for users, individually. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of the multi-task model compared to its single-task versions, reaching top-1 precision at 78.1% and 77.6%, for churn and NBP prediction respectively. Moreover, we find that the model learns a coherent and expressive high-level representation reflecting user intentions related to both tasks. There is a clear separation between users with acquisitions and users with churn. In addition, acquirers are more tightly clustered compared to the churners. The gradual separability of churning and acquiring users, who diverge in intent, is a desirable property. It provides a basis for model explainability, critical to industry adoption, and also enables other downstream applications. These potential additional benefits, beyond reducing customer attrition and increasing product use–two primary concerns of businesses, make such a model even more valuable."

In performing clustering, a similarity measure, which defines how similar a pair of data objects are, plays an important role. A similarity measure is employed by considering a target dataset’s characteristics. Current similarity measures (or distances) do not reflect the distribution of data objects in a dataset at all. From the clustering point of view, this fact may limit the clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose c-affinity, a new notion of a similarity measure that reflects the distribution of objects in the given dataset from a clustering point of view. We design c-affinity between any two objects to have a higher value as they are more likely to belong to the same cluster by learning the data distribution. We use random walk with restart (RWR) on the k-nearest neighbor graph of the given dataset to measure (1) how similar a pair of objects are and (2) how densely other objects are distributed between them. Via extensive experiments on sixteen synthetic and real-world datasets, we verify that replacing the existing similarity measure with our c-affinity improves the clustering accuracy significantly."

To solve this problem, several approaches have been proposed to automatically generate high-quality API documentation based on a combination of knowledge from different web sources. However, current researches are weak in handling unpopular APIs and cannot generate structured API documentation. Hence, in this poster, we propose a hybrid technique(namely gDoc) for the automatic generation of structured API documentation. We first present a fine-grained search-based strategy to generate the description for partial API parameters via computing the relevance between various APIs, ensuring the consistency of API documentation. Then, we employ the cross-modal pretraining Seq2Seq model M6 to generate a structured API document for each API, which treats the document generation problem as a translation problem. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm to extract practical parameter examples from API request logs. The experiments evaluated on the online system show that this work’s approach significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of API document generation."

We explore the knowledge, such as parameter characteristics (e.g., enumerability) and constraints (e.g., maximum/minimum value), from the massive API call logs to narrow the range of parameter values. Then, we propose a fine-grained approach to enrich the API documentation by extracting dependency knowledge between APIs.

In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the copyright protection measures for GANs, evaluate their performance across a diverse range of GAN architectures, and identify the factors that affect their performance and future research directions. Our findings indicate that the current IPR protection methods for input images, model watermarking, and attribution networks are largely satisfactory for a wide range of GANs. We highlight that further attention must be directed towards protecting training sets, as the current approaches fail to provide robust IPR protection and provenance tracing on training sets."

We propose a novel framework: layer-adaptive GNN (LAGNN) consisting of two modules: adaptive layer selection and random Droplayer, which can adaptively determine the number of layers and thus alleviate overfitting.

The resulting lack of high-quality labeled data stands in the way of conventional supervised learning methods. Instead, we approach this problem using semi-supervised learning with a large language model (LLM). Our pipeline generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation."

However, link prediction in knowledge hypergraph is still an underexplored field despite the ubiquity of n-ary facts in the real world. Several recent representative embedding-based knowledge hypergraph link prediction methods have proven to be effective in a series of benchmarks, however, they only consider the position (or role) information, ignoring the neighborhood structure among entities and rich semantic information within each fact. To this end, we propose a model named EnhancE for effective link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs. On the one hand, a more expressive entity representation is obtained with both position and neighborhood information added to the initial embedding. On the other hand, rich semantic information of the involved entities within each tuple is incorporated into relation embedding for enhanced representation. Extensive experimental results over real datasets of both knowledge hypergraph and knowledge graph demonstrate the excellent performance of EnhancE compared with a variety of state-of-the-art baselines."

This paper transforms the DNS data flow into time series, and proposes a DNS anomaly detection method based on graph attention network and graph embedding (GAT-DNS). GAT-DNS establishes a multivariate time series model to depict the DNS service status. When the actual flow of a feature exceeds the predicted range, it is considered that abnormal DNS behavior is found. In this paper, vertex dependency is proposed to describe the dependency between features. The features with high vertex dependency values are deleted to achieve model compression. This improves the system efficiency. Experiments on open data sets show that compared with the latest AD-Bop and QLAD methods, GAT-DNS method not only improves the precision, recall and F1 value, but also improves the time efficiency of the model."

First, we obtain word-pair representations by leveraging the output embeddings of the [MASK] token in the pre-trained language model. The representations are prepared for two tasks. The first task aims to train an analogical classifier by supervised learning. The second task is an auxiliary task based on relation clustering to generate relation pseudo-labels for word pairs and train relation classifier. Our method guides the model to analyze the relation similarity in analogical reasoning without relation labels. The experiments show that our method achieve excellent performance on four analogical reasoning datasets without the help of external corpus and knowledge.

Using autocompletion, the user can type a question in natural language, select a template, and again using autocompletion, select the entities they wish to insert into the template’s placeholders, generating a concrete question, query and results. The main objectives of Templet are: (i) to enable users to answer potentially complex questions over Wikidata using natural language templates and autocompletion; (ii) to encourage users to collaboratively create new templates via QAWiki, which in turn can benefit not only Templet, but other QA systems."

In the project, we will use both quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate the health of OSS projects. The quantitative metrics will be gathered through automated crawling of meta information such as the number of contributors, commits and lines of code. Qualitative metrics will be gathered for selected “critical” projects through manual analysis and automated tools, including aspects such as sustainability, funding, community engagement and adherence to security policies. The results of the analysis will be presented on a user-friendly web platform, which will allow users to view the health of individual OSS projects as well as the overall health of the OSS ecosystem. With this approach, the CrOSSD project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date view of the health of OSS projects, making it easier for developers, maintainers and other stakeholders to understand the health of OSS projects and make informed decisions about their use and maintenance."

In order to solve the lack of labeled data and implicit stance expression, we propose a self-supervised data augment approach based on coreference resolution. The method is specific for stance detection to generate more stable data and reduce the variance within and between classes to achieve a balance between validity and robustness. Considering the diversity of comments, we propose a novel multi-task stance detection framework of target-related fragment extraction and stance detection, which can enhance attention on target-related fragments and reduce the noise of other fragments.

The schema of tables can directly affect the system’s storage efficiency and query performance. Most current approaches are based on fixed schema(e.g., VP, ExtVP). When facing large-scale RDF datasets and complex SPARQL queries requiring many joins, such methods suffer from problems such as long pre-processing time and poor query performance. Schemas with Pareto Optimality between the system’s space consumption and query efficiency are needed but also hard to find. Therefore, we propose mStore, a prototype system with flexible schemas based on schema mining. The intuition behind our approach is that we want to divide the combinations of predicates with higher relevance into the same schema, which can replace costly joins with low-cost selects, improving the query performance. The results show that our system performs better on complex query workloads while reducing the pre-processing time overhead compared to systems with fixed schema partitioning strategies."

We first decouple the feature embeddings of items to learn the static preferences of different demanders. Next, a weighted directed global graph is constructed to model the associations among item categories. We partition short sequences by time intervals and look up category embeddings from the graph to capture dynamic intents. Finally, preferences and intentions are combined with learning the interests of different demanders. The conducted experiments demonstrate that our model improves the accuracy of recommendations."

However, past efforts generally focused on single-media retrieval, where the queries and retrieval results belong to the same media (platform) type, such as social media platforms or search engines. In single-media retrieval, users have to select search media or options based on search characteristics such as contents, time, or spatial distance, they might be unable to retrieve correct results mixed in other media if they carelessly forget to select. In this study, we propose a cross-media retrieval system using suggestion generation methods to integrate three search characteristics of the Web (textual content-based retrieval), SNS (timeliness), and map (spatial distance-aware retrieval). In our previous research, we attempted to improve search efficiency using clustering methods to provide search results to users through related terms, etc. In this paper, we focus on the search efficiency of multiple search media. We utilize Google search engine to obtain the retrieval content from the Web, Twitter to obtain timely information from SNSs, and Google Maps to get geographical information from maps. We apply the obtained retrieval results to analyze the similarities between them by clustering. Then, we generate relevant suggestions and provide them to users. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the search results generated by our proposed system."

These methods perform well in simple moment questions, but they are difficult to solve hard duration problems that need temporal relations and temporal numeric comparisons. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Multitask Learning (TML) with three auxiliary tasks to tackle with them. First, we propose a temporal-aware sequence labeling task to help the model distinguish the temporal expressions by detecting temporal types of tokens in the document. Then a temporal-aware masked language modeling task is used to capture the temporal relation between events based on the context. Furthermore, temporal-aware order learning is proposed to inject the ability of numeric comparison into the model. We carried out comprehensive experiments on the TimeQA benchmark, aiming to evaluate the performance of our proposed methodology in handling temporal question answering. TML significantly outperforms the baselines by a relative 10% on the two splits of the dataset."

There is a developing explosion in this socially disruptive mode of web-based information. Increasingly, we have seen various countries developing advanced methods to spread their targeted disinformation. To address this flood of disinformation will require refined strategies to capture and evaluate the messages. In this paper, we present both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of online social and information networks to better evaluate the characteristics of the disinformation campaigns. We focus on the case of Russian-generated disinformation, which has been developed to an elevated level. We demonstrate an effective approach based on a new dataset to study the Russian campaign composed of 14497 cases of dis-information and the corresponding counter-dis-information. Although this case is of high current relevance, there is very limited published evaluation. We provide a novel analysis and present a methodology to characterize this disinformation. We based our investigation on a Spherical k-means algorithm to determine the main topics of the disinformation and to discover the key trends. We employ distilBERT algorithm and achieve a high accuracy F1-score of 98.8 demonstrating good quantitative capabilities. We propose the methodology as a template for further exploration and analysis."

This attracted the interest of many research studies that analyzed social phenomena on Twitter, by collecting data, analysing communication patterns, and exploring the structure of user networks. While previous works share many common methodologies for data collection and analysis, these are mainly re-implemented every time by researchers in a custom way. In this paper, we introduce PyPoll an open-source Python library that operationalizes common analysis tasks for Twitter discussions. With PyPoll users can perform Twitter graph mining, calculate the polarization index and generate interactive visualizations without needing third-party tools. We believe that PyPoll can help researchers automate their tasks by giving them methods that are easy to use. Also, we demonstrate the use of the library by presenting two use cases; the PyPoll visualization app, an online application for graph visualizing and sharing, and the Political Lighthouse, a Web portal for displaying the polarization in various political topics on Twitter."

In this article we demonstrate, through a Web application, the capabilities of SPARQLprov, an engine-agnostic method that annotates query results with how-provenance annotations. To this end, SPARQLprov resorts to query rewriting techniques, which make it applicable to already deployed SPARQL endpoints.

In order to address this challenge, the W3C has promoted recommendations to allow expressing privacy policies. One of these recommendations is the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) vocabulary. Although this standard has wide adoption, it is not suitable in domains such as IoT, Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing, or discovery. The reason behind is the fact that ODRL privacy policies are not able to cope with dynamic information that may come from external sources of data and, therefore, these policies can not define privacy restrictions upon data that is not already written in the policy beforehand. In this demo paper, a solution to this challenge is presented. It is shown how ODRL policies can overcome the aforementioned limitation by being combined with a mapping language for RDF materialisation. The article shows how ODRL policies are able to consider data coming from an external data source when they are solved, in particular, a weather forecast API that provides temperature values. The demonstration defines an ODRL policy that grants access to a resource only when the temperature of the API is above a certain value."

Moreover, relevance evaluation for computational notebooks is tricky and unreliable since computational notebooks contain fragments of text and code and are usually poorly organized.

It provides step-by-step reasoning support to an end-user to summarize patient health, predict patient outcomes and provide comprehensive and personalized healthcare recommendations. MediSage provides these reasoning capabilities by using a knowledge graph that combines general purpose clinical knowledge resources with recent-most information from the EHR data. By combining the structured representation of knowledge with the predictive power of neural models trained over both EHR and knowledge graph data, MediSage brings explainability by construction and represents a stepping stone into the future through further integration with biomedical language models."

To address the pressing need for a client-side explainability solution, we present WebSHAP, the first in-browser tool that adapts the state-of-the-art model-agnostic explainability technique SHAP to the Web environment. Our open-source tool is developed with modern Web technologies such as WebGL that leverage client-side hardware capabilities and make it easy to integrate into existing Web ML applications.

Via extensive experiments with four graph algorithms and six real-world datasets, we show that (1) each of our strategies is effective in increasing the IO bandwidth, thereby reducing the execution time; (2) RealGraph+ with all of our strategies improves the original RealGraph significantly; (3) RealGraph+ outperforms state-of-the-art single-machine-based graph engines dramatically; (4) it shows performance comparable to or even better than those of other distributed-system-based graph engines."

One solution to users’ protection is developing online moderation tools using Machine Learning (ML) techniques for automatic detection or content filtering. On the other hand, the processing of user data requires compliance with privacy policies. In this paper, we propose a framework for developing content moderation tools in a privacy-preserving manner where sensitive information stays on the users’ device. For this purpose, we apply Differentially Private Federated Learning (DP–FL), where the training of ML models is performed locally on the users’ devices, and only the model updates are shared with a central entity. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we simulate harmful text classification on Twitter data in a distributed FL fashion– but the overall concept can be generalized to other types of misbehavior, data, and platforms. We show that the performance of the proposed FL framework can be close to the centralized approach – for both the DP–FL and non–DP FL. Moreover, it has a high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number of tweets) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of clients (from fifty to ten) or the tweets per client (from 1K to 100), the classifier can still achieve AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to four other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior and still obtain a promising performance (61% – 80% AUC). Finally, we explore the overhead on the users’ devices during the FL training phase and show that the local training does not introduce excessive CPU utilization and memory consumption overhead."

This transformer-based framework uses linear pairwise loss with mutable training batch sizes and achieves quality gains and high efficiency, and has been applied effectively to show gains on two industry tasks at Microsoft over real-world large-scale data sets: Smart Reply (SR) and Ambient Clinical Intelligence (ACI). In Smart Reply, sRank assists live customers with technical support by selecting the best reply from predefined solutions based on consumer and support agent messages. It achieves 11.7% gain in offline top-one accuracy on the SR task over the previous system, and has enabled 38.7% time reduction in composing messages in telemetry recorded since its general release in January 2021. In the ACI task, sRank selects relevant historical physician templates that serve as guidance for a text summarization model to generate higher quality medical notes.

We propose an effective and efficient model called CTNet to perform CTR prediction under the CTL setting. The core idea behind CTNet is to treat source domain representations as external knowledge for target domain CTR prediction, such that the continually well-trained source and target domain parameters can be preserved and reused during knowledge transfer.

In short, given a cold-start song request, we expect to retrieve songs with similar audiences and then fastly push the cold-start song to the audiences of the retrieved songs to warm up it. However, there are hardly any studies done on this task. Therefore, in this paper, we will formalize the problem of Music Cold-Start Matching detailedly and give a scheme. During the offline training, we attempt to learn high-quality song representations based on song content features. But, we find supervision signals typically follow power-law distribution causing skewed representation learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel contrastive learning paradigm named Bootstrapping Contrastive Learning (BCL) to enhance the quality of learned representations by exerting contrastive regularization. During the online serving, to locate the target audiences more accurately, we propose Clustering-based Audience Targeting (CAT) that clusters audience representations to acquire a few cluster centroids and then locate the target audiences by measuring the relevance between the audience representations and the cluster centroids. Extensive experiments on the offline dataset and online system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Currently, we have deployed it on NetEase Cloud Music, affecting millions of users."

Given a user query, the retrieval phase returns a subset of candidate products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search, user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal information of (user query, product title, product image). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-specific pre-training model (referred to as MAKE) outperforms existing V+L pre-training methods on the text-to-multimodal retrieval task. MAKE has been deployed online and brings major improvements on the retrieval system of Taobao Search."

Alternatively, she may choose to come back later and this long-term feedback is also modeled to promote user retention. However, the long-term feedback comes with non-trivial challenges in understanding user retention: the complicated correlation between current demands and follow-up demands, coupled with the periodicity of services. For instance, before the movie, the customer buys popcorn through the App, which temporally correlates with the initial movie recommendation. Days later, she checks the App for new movies, as a weekly routine. To address this complexity in a more fine-grained revisit modeling, we propose Time Aware Service Sequential Recommendation (TASSR) for user retention, which is equipped with a multi-task design and an In-category TimeSeqBlock module.

First, when dealing with large corpus of candidate items, EBR models often have difficulties in balancing the performance on distinguishing highly relevant items (positives) from both irrelevant ones (easy negatives) and from somewhat related yet not competitive ones (hard negatives). Also, we have little control in the diversity and fairness of the retrieval results because of the “greedy” nature of nearest vector search.

This approach allows our EBR models to only concentrate on discriminating positives from mostly hard negatives. It also enables further improvement from a multi-tasking learning (MTL) perspective: retrieval problems within each cluster can be regarded as individual tasks; inspired by recent successes in prompting and prefix-tuning, we propose an efficient task adaption technique further boosting the retrieval performance within each cluster with negligible overheads.

In industrial practice, existing failure prediction approaches mainly focus on utilizing state-of-the-art time series models to enhance the performance of failure prediction but neglect the training strategy. However, as curriculum learning points out, models perform better when they are trained with data in an order of easy-to-difficult. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a novel training strategy for cloud failure prediction, which greatly improves the performance of the existing cloud failure prediction models. Our experimental results on industrial and public datasets show that EDITS can obviously enhance the performance of cloud failure prediction model. In addition, EDITS also outperforms other curriculum learning methods. More encouragingly, our proposed EDITS has been successfully applied to Microsoft 365 and Azure online service systems, and has obviously reduced financial losses caused by cloud failures."

However, selecting appropriate hardness levels for personalized recommendations remains a fundamental, yet underexplored, problem. Previous HNS works have primarily adjusted the hardness level by tuning a single hyperparameter. However, applying the same hardness level to each user is unsuitable due to varying user behavioral characteristics, the quantity and quality of user records, and different consistencies of models’ inductive biases. Moreover, increasing the number of hyperparameters is not practical due to the massive number of users. To address this important and challenging problem, we propose a model-agnostic and practical approach called hardness-personalized negative sampling (HAPENS). HAPENS uses a two-stage approach: in stage one, it trains the ICF model with a customized objective function that optimizes its worst performance on each user’s interacted item set. In stage two, it utilizes these worst performances as personalized hardness levels with a well-designed sampling distribution, and trains the final model with the same architecture. We evaluated HAPENS on the collected Bing advertising dataset and one public dataset, and the comprehensive experimental results demonstrate its robustness and superiority. Moreover, HAPENS has delivered significant benefits to the Bing advertising system. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this important and challenging problem."

To alleviate this burden, we built a pipeline to automatically extract the job types from business websites. We share the various challenges we faced while developing this pipeline, and how we effectively addressed these challenges by (1) utilizing structured content to tackle the cold start problem for dataset collection; (2) exploiting context information to improve model performance without hurting scalability; and (3) formulating the extraction problem as a retrieval task to improve both generalizability, efficiency, and coverage. The pipeline has been deployed for over a year and is scalable enough to be periodically refreshed. The extracted job types are serving users of Google Search and Google Maps, with significant improvements in both precision and coverage."

However, user interacting with an item may also due to conformity, the need to follow popular items. Most previous studies neglect user’s conformity and entangle interest with it, which may cause the recommender systems fail to provide satisfying results. Therefore, from the cause-effect view, disentangling these interaction causes is a crucial issue. It also contributes to OOD problems, where training and test data are out-of-distribution. Nevertheless, it is quite challenging as we lack the signal to differentiate interest and conformity. The data sparsity of pure cause and the items’ long-tail problem hinder disentangled causal embedding. In this paper, we propose DCCL, a framework that adopts contrastive learning to disentangle these two causes by sample augmentation for interest and conformity respectively. Futhermore, DCCL is model-agnostic, which can be easily deployed in any industrial online system. Extensive experiments are conducted over two real-world datasets and DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on top of various backbone models in various OOD environments. We also demonstrate the performance improvements by online A/B testing on Kuaishou, a billion-user scale short-video recommender system."

These methods adopt a two-tower framework to learn embedding vectors for query and item separately and thus leverage efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to retrieve relevant items. However, existing EBR methods usually ignore inconsistent user behaviors in industrial multi-stage search systems, resulting in insufficient retrieval efficiency with a low commercial return. To tackle this challenge, we propose to improve EBR methods by learning Multi-level Multi-Grained Semantic Embeddings (MMSE). We propose the multi-stage information mining to exploit the ordered, clicked, unclicked and random sampled items in practical user behavior data, and then capture query-item similarity via a post-fusion strategy. We then propose multi-grained learning objectives that integrate the retrieval loss with global comparison ability and the ranking loss with local comparison ability to generate semantic embeddings. Both experiments on a real-world billion-scale dataset and online A/B tests verify the effectiveness of MMSE in achieving significant performance improvements on metrics such as offline recall and online conversion rate (CVR)."

The objective of the recommendation is to optimize user retention, thereby driving the growth of DAU (Daily Active Users). Retention is a long-term feedback after multiple interactions of users and the system, and it is hard to decompose retention reward to each item or a list of items. Thus traditional point-wise and list-wise models are not able to optimize retention. In this paper, we choose reinforcement learning methods to optimize the retention as they are designed to maximize the long-term performance. We formulate the problem as an infinite-horizon request-based Markov Decision Process, and our objective is to minimize the accumulated time interval of multiple sessions, which is equal to improving the app open frequency and user retention. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms can not be directly applied in this setting due to uncertainty, bias, and long delay time incurred by the properties of user retention. We propose a novel method, dubbed RLUR, to address the aforementioned challenges. Both offline and live experiments show that RLUR can significantly improve user retention. RLUR has been fully launched in Kuaishou app for a long time, and achieves consistent performance improvement on user retention and DAU."

Intent modeling is thus critical for understanding users and optimizing long-term user experience. We propose a probabilistic modeling approach and formulate user intent as latent variables, which are inferred based on user behavior signals using variational autoencoders (VAE).

Our experiments consider the domain of home improvement product recommendation, where resource pages are DIY (do-it-yourself) project pages from Lowes.com. Each DIY page provides a list of tools, materials, and step-by-step instructions to complete a DIY project, such as building a deck, installing cabinets, and fixing a leaking pipe. We use this data as an indicator of the intended project, which is a natural high-level intent signal for home improvement shoppers.

We further demonstrate that our system can be used to successfully recommend DIY project pages to users.

First, we extend the original GBCT method to a multi-treatment setting and take the monotonic constraints into consideration, so that more typical industrial necessities can be resolved with our framework. Moreover, we implement DGBCT based on the ‘Controller-Coordinator-Worker’ framework, in which dual failover mechanism is achieved, and commendable flexibility is ensured. In addition, empirical results show that DGBCT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art causal trees, and has a near-linear speedup as the number of workers grows.

The intents are resolved based on semantic similarities between user utterances and the text descriptions of the internal nodes of the intent tree or the intent examples in the leaf nodes of the tree. Our results show that an off-the-shelf language model can work reasonably well in a large enterprise deployment without fine-tuning, and its performance can be further improved with fine-tuning as more domain-specific data becomes available. We also show that the fine-tuned language model meets and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in resolving conversation intents without training classifiers. With the use of a topological intent tree, our model provides more interpretability to cultivate people’s trust in their decisions."

QAC on eCommerce sites usually employ Learning to Rank (LTR) approaches based on customer behaviour signals such as clicks and conversion rates to optimize business metrics. However, they do not exclusively optimize for the quality of suggested queries which results in lack of navigational suggestions like product categories and attributes, e.g., \"sports shoes\" and \"white shoes\" for query \"shoes\". We propose to improve the quality of query suggestions by introducing navigational suggestions without impacting the business metrics. For this purpose, we augment the customer behaviour (CB) based objective with Query-Quality (QQ) objective and assemble them with trainable mixture weights to define multi-objective optimization function. We propose to optimize this multi-objective function by implementing ALMO algorithm to obtain a model robust against any mixture weight. We show that this formulation improves query relevance on an eCommerce QAC dataset by at least 13% over the baseline Deep Pairwise LTR (DeepPLTR) with minimal impact on MRR and results in a lift of 0.26% in GMV in an online A/B test. We also evaluated our approach on public search logs datasets and got improvement in query relevance by using query coherence as QQ objective."

Previous studies mainly apply CTR models to the field of recommendation or online advertisement. Indeed, CTR is also critical in information retrieval, since the CTR probability can serve as a valuable feature for a query-document pair. In this paper, we study the CTR task under account search scenario in WeChat, where users search official accounts or mini programs corresponding to an organization. Despite the large number of CTR models, directly applying them to our task is inappropriate since the account retrieval task has a number of specific characteristics. E.g., different from traditional user-centric CTR models, in our task, CTR prediction is query-centric and does not model user information. In addition, queries and accounts are short texts, and heavily rely on prior knowledge and semantic understanding. These characteristics require us to specially design a CTR model for the task. To this end, we propose a novel CTR prediction model named Knowledge eNhanced hIerarchical Fusion nEtwork (KNIFE). Specifically, to tackle the prior information problem, we mine the knowledge graph of accounts as side information; to enhance the representations of queries, we construct a bipartite graph for queries and accounts. In addition, a hierarchical network structure is proposed to fuse the representations of different information in a fine-grained manner. Finally, the representations of queries and accounts are obtained from this hierarchical network and fed into the CTR model together with other features for prediction. We conduct extensive experiments against 12 existing models across two industrial datasets. Both offline and online A/B test results indicate the effectiveness of KNIFE."

Numerous efforts have been made in user multi-domain intent modeling to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods mainly focus on the domains having rich user information, which makes implementation to domains with sparse or rare user behavior meet with mixed success. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel method named Meta-generator enhanced multi-Domain model (MetaDomain) to address the above issue. MetaDomain mainly includes two steps, 1) users’ multi-domain intent representation and 2) users’ multi-domain intent fusion. Specifically, in users’ multi-domain intent representation, we use the gradient information from a domain intent extractor to train the domain intent meta-generator, where the domain intent extractor has the input of users’ sequence feature and domain meta-generator has the input of users’ basic feature, hence the capability of generating users’ intent with sparse behavior. Afterward, in users’ multi-domain intent fusion, a domain graph is used to represent the high-order multi-domain connectivity. Extensive experiments have been carried out under a real-world industrial platform named Meituan. Both offline and rigorous online A/B tests under the billion-level data scale demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MetaDomain method over the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore comparing with the method using multi-domain sequence features, MetaDomain can reduce the serving latency by 20%. Currently, MetaDomain has been deployed in Meituan one of the largest worldwide Online-to-Offline(O2O) platforms."

In this paper, we propose a task adaptive multi-learner (TAML) framework for joint CTR and CVR prediction. We design a hierarchical task adaptive knowledge representation module with different experts to capture knowledge in different granularities, which can effectively exploit the commonalities between CTR and CVR estimation tasks meanwhile keeping their unique characteristics. We apply multiple learners to extract data knowledge from various views and fuse their predictions to obtain accurate and robust scores. To facilitate knowledge sharing across learners, we further perform self-distillation that uses the fused scores to teach different learners.

Our methodology can be easily integrated into an existing large-scale recommender system with minimal modifications. We also analyze the value of exploration by defining relevant metrics around user-creator connections and understanding how this helps the overall recommendation pipeline with strong online gains in creator and ecosystem value. In contrast to the regression on user engagement metrics generally seen while exploring, our method is able to achieve significant improvements of 3.50% in strong creator connections and 0.85% increase in novel creator connections.

CAM2 addresses these challenges systematically by leveraging causal modeling to disentangle users’ conformity to popular items from their true interests. This framework is generalizable and can be scaled to support multiple representations of conformity and user relevance in any large-scale recommender system. We provide deeper practical insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through improvements in offline evaluation metrics compared to our production multi-task ranking model.

Due to this, diversity has to be introduced through the application of heuristic-based rules, which are not able to capture user preferences, or make balanced trade-offs in terms of diversity and item relevance. In this paper, we propose a novel method which introduces diversity by modeling the impact of low diversity on user’s engagement on individual items, thus being able to account for both diversity and relevance to adjust item scores. The proposed method is designed to be easily pluggable into existing large-scale recommender systems, while introducing minimal changes in the recommendations stack.

Conventional MSDA methods are built on a strong hypothesis that data samples from the same source belong to the same domain with the same latent distribution. However, in practice sources and their latent domains are not necessarily one-to-one correspondence. To tackle this problem, a novel Multi-source Reconstructed Domain Adaptation (MRDA) framework for MSDA is proposed. We use an Expectation-Maximization (EM) mechanism that iteratively reconstructs the source domains to recover the latent domains and performs domain adaptation on the reconstructed domains. Specifically, in the E-step, we cluster the samples from multiple sources into different latent domains, and a soft assignment strategy is proposed to avoid cluster imbalance. In the M-step, we freeze the latent domains clustered in the E-step and optimize the objective function for domain adaptation, and a global-specific feature extractor is used to capture both domain-invariant and domain-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can reconstruct source domains and perform domain adaptation on the reconstructed domains effectively, thus significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines (e.g., 1% to 3.1% absolute improvement in AUC)."

In this paper, we transform the problem of locating faulty applications into two subproblems and propose a fully automated framework. We design a scorecard model in one stage to evaluate the semantic relevance between applications and customer complaints. Then in the other stage, topology graphs that reflect the actual calling relationship and engineering connection relationship between applications are utilized to evaluate the topology relevance between applications. Specifically, we employ a multi-graph co-learning framework constrained by consistency-independence loss and an engineering-theory-driven clustering strategy for the unsupervised learning of graphs. With semantic and topology relevance, we can comprehensively locate relevant faulty applications. Experiments on the Alipay dataset show that our method gains significant improvements in both model performance and efficiency."

DAWs are feature-rich software and therefore particularly complex to develop in terms of design, implementation, performances and ergonomics. Very few commercial online DAWs exist today and the only open-source examples lack features (no support for inter-operable plugins, for example) and do not take advantage of the recent possibilities offered by modern W3C APIs (e.g. AudioWorklets/Web Assembly). WAM Studio was developed as an open-source technology demonstrator with the aim of showcasing the potential of the web platform, made possible by these APIs. The paper highlights some of the difficulties we encountered (i.e limitations due to the sandboxed and constrained environments that are Web browsers, latency compensation etc.).

KGs are generally constructed either manually or automatically using a variety of extraction techniques applied over multiple data sources. Due to the diverse quality of these data sources, there are likely anomalies introduced into any KG. Hence, it is unrealistic to expect a perfect archive of knowledge. Given how large KGs can be, manual validation is impractical, necessitating an automated approach for anomaly detection in KGs. To improve KG quality, and to identify interesting and abnormal triples (edges) and entities (nodes) that are worth investigating, we introduce SEKA, a novel unsupervised approach to detect anomalous triples and entities in a KG using both the structural characteristics and the content of edges and nodes of the graph. While an anomaly can be an interesting or unusual discovery, such as a fraudulent transaction requiring human intervention, anomaly detection can also identify potential errors. We propose a novel approach named Corroborative Path Algorithm to generate a matrix of semantic features, which we then use to train a one-class Support Vector Machine to identify abnormal triples and entities with no dependency on external sources. We evaluate our approach on four real-world KGs demonstrating the ability of SEKA to detect anomalies, and to outperform comparative baselines."

(ii) The obtained embeddings do not contain much semantic information. Therefore, using these embeddings for semantic tasks is problematic. (iii) They do not enable large-scale training.

The initial results reveal several features of interaction with exploited species. Namely, there are a high number of tweets indicating that individuals participated in exploited species activities during vacations in destinations that double as native countries for the exploited species. The data also indicate that a large number of exploited species activities take place at fairs, carnivals, and circuses. These initial results shed light on the trends in human participation in activities with exploited species.

We discuss the societal impact of browser gaming and how it has allowed a new target audience to access digital gaming. Finally, we review the potential future evolution of the browser gaming industry."

It is told across three time periods: 1997, 2010, and 2021. The story describes how the island first connected to the internet in the 90s, how internet access evolved throughout the 2000s, and ends in the role the internet played in the government protests on July 11, 2021. The article analyzes how internet access in Cuba has changed over the decades and its effects on civil society. It discusses issues such as Cuba’s technological infrastructure, internet censorship, and free expression."

It is widely used in applications and research. At its launch in late 2012, however, it was little more than a hopeful new Wikimedia project, with no content, almost no community, and a severely restricted platform. Seven years earlier still, in 2005, it was merely a rough idea of a few PhD students, a conceptual nucleus that had yet to pick up many important influences from others to turn into what is now called Wikidata. In this paper, we try to recount this remarkable journey, and we review what has been accomplished, what has been given up on, and what is yet left to do for the future."

These opportunities were limited to western audiences earlier on, but globalization has now put almost the entire world online. While there is a growing social understanding and acknowledgment of various gender and ethnic groups in society, we still have a long way to go toward achieving equity in gender and ethnic representations, especially in the workplace. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the diversity and evenness in terms of gender and ethnicity of The WebConference participants over its 30 year history. The choice is motivated by the monumental contribution of this conference to the evolution of the web. In particular, we study the gender and ethnicity of program committee members, authors and other speakers at the conference between 1994-2022. We also generate the co-speaker network over the three decades to study how closely the speakers work with each other. Our findings show that we still have a long way to go before achieving fair representation at The WebConference, especially for female participants and individuals from non-White, non-Asian ethnicities."

Did you ever notice that many links, specifically hyperlinks, are blue? When a coworker casually asked me why links are blue, I was stumped. As a user experience designer who has created websites since 2001, I've always made my links blue. I have advocated for the specific shade of blue, and for the consistent application of blue, yes, but I've never stopped and wondered, why are links blue? It was just a fact of life. Grass is green and hyperlinks are blue. Culturally, we associate links with the color blue so much that in 2016, when Google changed its links to black, it created quite a disruption [1]."

The workshop series aim to investigate the role of the Web and of Web applications in SC growth. This year, the workshop focuses on the role of the web in social coherence. cities appear to play a crucial role in securing humanity against social threats and generating sustainable and circular cities. In this regard, cities attempt to secure social sustainability and coherence (e.g., deal with affordable energy, poverty, hunger, equal opportunities in education, jobs, and health, etc.) and enhance their performance to become friendlier and able to host their increasing populations. Additionally, new types of business appear (e.g., for smart energy), while the co-existence of autonomous things and people generate another challenge that cities have started phasing.

The smart city hub (SCHub) introduces a new concept that aims to homogenize data, service, human and material flows in cities. A proof of concept is based on non-typical data flows, like the ones that are collected by biotechnological activities, like Diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths globally. Most of the diet related NCDs are related to the gut microbiome, the microbial community that resides in our gastrointestinal tract. The imbalance or loss of microbiome diversity is one of the main factors leading to NCDs by affecting various functions, including energy metabolism, intestinal permeability, and brain function. Gut dysbiosis is reflected in altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), produced by the gut microbiota. A microcapsule system can play the role of a sensor that collects data from the local community and transmits it to the SCHub in order for the doctors to receive the appropriate patients information and define the appropriate treatment method; for the city to process anonymized information and measure community's health in diet terms. A prototype with a biosensor that correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacities is presented in this paper, together with the use-case scenario that engages the SCHub."

Furthermore, we sought to develop a method to enhance the spatial resolution of publicly available LST temperature data (such as those measured from the Landsat satellites) by building a machine learning model utilizing remote-sensed data from drones. While we found a high correlation and an accurate degree of prediction for areas of open water and vegetation (respectively), our model struggled when it came to areas containing highly impervious surfaces. We believe, however, that these findings further illustrate the discrepancy between high and medium spatial resolutions, and demonstrate how urban environments specifically are prone to inaccurate LST measurements and are uniquely in need of an industry pursuit of higher spatial resolution for hyperlocal environmental sciences and urban analysis."

Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains. This will enable us to in the future explore what existing knowledge can be adapted or used to develop ontologies for circular value networks."

Standard click propensity estimation techniques rely on simple models of user browsing behavior that primarily account for the attributes of the presentation context that affect whether the relevance of an item to the search context is observed. Most notably, the inherent effect of the listwise presentation of the items on users’ propensity for engagement is captured in the position of the presented items on the search result page. In this work, we enrich this position bias based click propensity model by proposing an observation model that further incorporates the underlying search intent, as reflected in the user’s click pattern in the search context. Our approach does not require an intent prediction model based on the content of the search context. Instead, we rely on a simple, yet effective, non-causal estimate of the user’s browsing intent from the number of click events in the search context. We empirically characterize the distinct rank decay patterns of the estimated click propensities in the characterized intent classes. In particular, we demonstrate a sharper decay of click propensities in top ranks for the intent class identified by sparse user clicks and the higher likelihood of observing clicks in lower ranks for the intent class identified by higher number of user clicks. We show that the proposed intent-aware propensity estimation technique helps with training ranking models with more effective personalization and generalization power through empirical results for a ranking task in a major e-commerce platform."

Most global streaming services have introduced Machine Learning (ML) into their operations to personalize consumer experience, improve content, and further enhance the value proposition of streaming services. Despite the rapid growth, there is a need to bridge the gap between academic research and industry requirements and build connections between researchers and practitioners in the field. This workshop aims to provide a unique forum for practitioners and researchers interested in Machine Learning to get together, exchange ideas and get a pulse for the state of the art in research and burning issues in the industry."

In non-English speaking countries like India, Nepal and many others, the regional titles are transliterated from native language to English and are being searched in English. Given that there can be multiple transliterations possible for almost all the titles, searching for a regional title can be a very frustrating customer experience if these nuances are not handled correctly by the search system. Typing errors make the problem even more challenging. Streaming services uses spell correction and auto-suggestions/auto-complete features to address this issue up to certain extent. Auto-suggest fails when user searches keywords not in scope of the auto-suggest. Spell correction is effective at correcting common typing errors but as these titles doesn’t follow strict grammar rules and new titles constantly added to the catalog, spell correction have limited success."

An entity can be a person, organization, work-of-art, etc., while an event, such as the Opioid epidemic, occurs at specific point(s) in time. ELTE first extracts key-phrases from episode title and description metadata. It then uses entity linking to canonicalize them against Wikipedia knowledge base (KB), ensuring that the topics exist in the real world. ELTE also models NIL-predictions for entity or event topics that are not in the KB, as well as topics that are not of entity or event type. To test the model, we construct a podcast topic database of 1166 episodes from various categories. Each episode comes with a Wiki-link annotated main topic or NIL-prediction. ELTE produces the best overall Exact Match EM score of .84, with by-far the best EM of .89 among the entity or event type episodes, as well as NIL-predictions for episodes without entity or event main topic (EM score of .86)."

This problem is aggravated when there is no behavioral data available for new content. Poor quality recommendation for these items lead to user dissatisfaction and short content shelf-life. In this paper we propose a solution MEMER (Multimodal Encoder for Multi-signal Early-stage Recommendations), that utilises the multimodal semantic information of content and uses it to generate better quality embeddings for early-stage items. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework by extending it to various explicit and implicit user actions. Using these learnt embeddings, we conduct offline and online experiments to verify its effectiveness. The predicted embeddings show significant gains in online early-stage experiments for both videos and images (videos:  44% relative gain in click through rate,  46% relative gain in explicit engagements,  9% relative gain in successful video play,  20% relative reduction in skips, images:  56% relative gain in explicit engagements). This also compares well against the performance of mature embeddings (83.3% RelaImpr (RI) [18] in Successful Video Play, 97.8% RelaImpr in Clicks)."

However, many of the data samples and subsequent analyses published by researchers are not uploaded to a repository leaving the scientific paper as the only available source. Automated extraction of scientific data is, therefore, a valuable tool for such researchers. Specifically, much of the most valuable data in scientific papers are structured as tables, making these a prime target for information extraction research. Using the data relies on an additional step where the concepts mentioned in the tables, such as names of measures, units, and biological species, are identified within a domain ontology. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art table extraction leaves much to be desired and has not been attempted on a large scale on oceanographic papers. Furthermore, while entity linking in the context of a full paragraph of text has been heavily researched, it is still lacking in this harder task of linking single concepts. In this work, we present an annotated benchmark dataset of data tables from oceanographic papers. We further present the result of an evaluation on the extraction of these tables and the linking of the contained entities to the domain and general-purpose knowledge bases using the current state of the art. We highlight the challenges and quantify the performance of current tools for table extraction and table-concept linking."

Most approaches are based on variants of graph neural networks (GNNs) that focus on transductive link prediction and have high inference latency. However, many real-world applications require fast inference over new nodes in inductive settings where no information on connectivity is available for these nodes. Thereby, node features provide an inevitable alternative in the latter scenario. To that end, we propose Graph2Feat, which enables inductive link prediction by exploiting knowledge distillation (KD) through the Student-Teacher learning framework. In particular, Graph2Feat learns to match the representations of a lightweight student multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a more expressive teacher GNN while learning to predict missing links based on the node features, thus attaining both GNN’s expressiveness and MLP’s fast inference. Furthermore, our approach is general; it is suitable for transductive and inductive link predictions on different types of graphs regardless of them being homogeneous or heterogeneous, directed or undirected. We carry out extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that Graph2Feat significantly outperforms SOTA methods in terms of AUC and average precision in homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Finally, Graph2Feat has the minimum inference time compared to the SOTA methods, and 100x acceleration compared to GNNs. The code and datasets are available on GitHub1."

Citation metrics are universally used methods to evaluate researchers. Amongst the several variations of citation metrics, the h-index proposed by Hirsch has become the leading measure. Recent work shows that h-index is not an effective measure to determine scientific impact - due to changing authorship patterns. This can be mitigated by using h-index of a paper to compute h-index of an author. We show that using fractional allocation of h-index gives better results. In this work, we reapply two indices based on the h-index of a single paper. The indices are referred to as: hp-index and hp-frac-index. We run large-scale experiments in three different fields with about a million publications and 3,000 authors. Our experiments show that hp-frac-index provides a unique ranking when compared to h-index. It also performs better than h-index in providing higher ranks to the awarded researcher."

One such problem faced by e-commerce platforms is Return To Origin (RTO), where the user cancels an order while it is in transit for delivery. In such a scenario platform faces logistics and opportunity costs. Traditionally, models trained on historical trends are used to predict the propensity of an order becoming RTO. Sociology literature has highlighted clear correlations between socio-economic indicators and users’ tendency to exploit systems to gain financial advantage. Social media profiles have information about location, education, and profession which have been shown to be an estimator of socio-economic condition. We believe combining social media data with e-commerce information can lead to improvements in a variety of tasks like RTO, recommendation, fraud detection, and credit modeling. In our proposed system, we find the public social profile of an e-commerce user and extract socio-economic features. Internal data fused with extracted social features are used to train a RTO order detection model. Our system demonstrates a performance improvement in RTO detection of 3.1% and 19.9% on precision and recall, respectively. Our system directly impacts the bottom line revenue and shows the applicability of social re-identification in e-commerce."

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution to improve seasonal relevance in product search by incorporating seasonality into language models for semantic matching. We first identify seasonal queries and products by analyzing implicit seasonal contexts through time-series analysis over the past year. Then we introduce explicit seasonal contexts by enhancing the query representation with a season token according to when the query is issued. A new season-enhanced BERT model (SE-BERT) is also proposed to learn the semantic similarity between the resulting seasonal queries and products. SE-BERT utilizes Multi-modal Adaption Gate (MAG) to augment the season-enhanced semantic embedding with other contextual information such as product price and review counts for robust relevance prediction. To better align with the ranking objective, a listwise loss function (neural NDCG) is used to regularize learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms existing solutions for query-product relevance prediction in terms of NDCG and Price Weighted Purchases (PWP)."

These models provide candidate items for a user’s query from a target space of millions to billions of items. Models with different inductive biases provide relatively different predictions, making it desirable to launch multiple semantic models in production.

In this paper, we introduce a distillation approach, called Blend and Match (BM), to unify two different semantic search models into a single model. We use a Bi-encoder semantic matching model as our primary model and propose a novel loss function to incorporate eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) predictions as the secondary model. Our experiments conducted on two large-scale datasets, collected from a popular e-commerce store, show that our proposed approach significantly improves the recall of the primary Bi-encoder model by 11% to 17% with a minimal loss in precision. We show that traditional knowledge distillation approaches result in a sub-optimal performance for our problem setting, and our BM approach yields comparable rankings with strong Rank Fusion (RF) methods used only if one could deploy multiple models."

Our novel approach involves using machine learning techniques to tag customer questions in transcripts and create a repository of questions and corresponding labels. When a customer requests assistance, an information retrieval model searches the repository for similar questions, and statistical analysis is used to predict the corresponding label.

Machine Translation (MT) provides an opportunity to lift relevance by translating the Spanish queries to English before delivering them to the search engine. However, polysemy-derived problems, high latency and context scarcity in product search, make generic MT an impractical solution. The wide diversity of products in marketplaces injects non-translatable entities, loanwords, ambiguous morphemes, cross-language ambiguity and a variety of Spanish dialects in the communication between buyers and sellers, posing a thread to the accuracy of MT. In this work, we leverage domain adaptation on a simplified architecture of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to make both latency and accuracy suitable for e-commerce search. Our NMT model is fine-tuned on a mixed-domain corpus based on engagement data expanded with catalog back-translation techniques. Beyond accuracy, and given that translation is not the goal but the means to relevant results, the problem of Query Translatability is addressed by a classifier on whether the translation should be automatic or explicitly requested. We assembled these models into a query translation system that we tested and launched at Walmart.com , with a statistically significant lift in Spanish GMV and an nDCG gain for Spanish queries of +70%."

This task is not trivial as often there can be a mismatch between the user’s intent and the product inventory for various reasons, the most prevalent being: (i) the buyers and sellers use different vocabularies, which leads to a mismatch; (ii) the inventory doesn’t contain products that match the user’s intent. To build a successful e-commerce platform it is of paramount importance to be able to address both of these challenges. To do so, query rewriting approaches are used, which try to bridge the semantic gap between the user’s intent and the available product inventory. Such approaches use a combination of query token dropping, replacement and expansion. In this work we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-enhanced neural query rewriting in the e-commerce domain. We use a relationship-rich product Knowledge Graph to infuse auxiliary knowledge in a transformer-based query rewriting deep neural network. Experiments on two tasks, query pruning and complete query rewriting, show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline BERT-based query rewriting solution."

Interleaving emerges as an online testing method with orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than the pervading A/B testing. It merges the compared results into a single interleaved result to show to users, and attributes user actions back to the systems being tested. However, its pairwise design also brings practical challenges to real-world systems, in terms of effectively comparing multiple (more than two) systems and interpreting the magnitude of raw interleaving measurement. We present two novel methods to address these challenges that make interleaving practically applicable. The first method infers the ordering of multiple systems based on interleaving pairwise results with false discovery control. The second method estimates A/B effect size based on interleaving results using a weighted linear model that adjust for uncertainties of different measurements. We showcase the effectiveness of our methods in large-scale e-commerce experiments, reporting as many as 75 interleaving results, and provide extensive evaluations of their underlying assumptions."

However, the use of such algorithms comes with trade-offs in terms of algorithmic fairness, which has been widely acknowledged. Specifically, we have empirically observed that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn, causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive users. To address the above issues, we propose DP-Fair, a two-stage framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations. The experimental results, based on Amazon datasets, and user history logs collected from Etsy, one of the largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of both overall accuracy and user group fairness on both shallow and deep recommendation models compared to vanilla DP-SGD."

We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising paradigm for this goal, as it directly optimizes overall performance of sequential recommendation. However, many existing RL-based approaches induce huge computational overhead, because they require not only the recommended items but also all other candidate items to be stored. This paper proposes an efficient alternative that does not require the candidate items. The idea is to model the correlation between user engagement and items directly from data. Moreover, the proposed approach consider randomness in user feedback and termination behavior, which are ubiquitous for RS but rarely discussed in RL-based prior work. With online A/B experiments on real-world RS, we confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach and the importance of modeling the two types of randomness."

We discover that the two methods behave very differently depending on the sparsity of the data set, where sparsity is defined by the amount of historical viewing data available to explain a movie recommendation for a particular data instance. We find that LIME does better than SHAP in dense segments of the data set and SHAP does better in sparse segments. We trace this difference to the differing bias-variance characteristics of the underlying estimators of LIME and SHAP. We find that SHAP exhibits lower variance in sparse segments of the data compared to LIME. We attribute this lower variance to the completeness constraint property inherent in SHAP and missing in LIME. This constraint acts as a regularizer and therefore increases the bias of the SHAP estimator but decreases its variance, leading to a favorable bias-variance trade-off especially in high sparsity data settings. With this insight, we introduce the same constraint into LIME and formulate a novel local explainabilty framework called Completeness-Constrained LIME (CLIME) that is superior to LIME and much faster than SHAP."

Such systems often deal with massive item sets and incredibly sparse user-item interactions, which makes it very challenging to generate high-quality personalized recommendations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for sequential decision making and naturally formulates recommender-system tasks: recommending items as actions in different user and context states to maximize long-term user experience. We investigate two RL policy parameterizations that generalize sparse user-items interactions by leveraging the relationships between actions: parameterizing the policy over action features as a softmax or Gaussian distribution. Our experiments on synthetic problems suggest that the Gaussian parameterization—which is not commonly used on recommendation tasks—is more robust to the set of action features than the softmax parameterization. Based on these promising results, we propose a more thorough investigation of the theoretical properties and empirical benefits of the Gaussian parameterization for recommender systems."

By simulating patients at a more fundamental level than conventional machine learning models, digital twins can provide unique insights by predicting each patient's outcome trajectory. This has numerous associated benefits, including patient-specific clinical decision-making support and the potential for large-scale virtual clinical trials. Historically, it has not been feasible to use digital twin technology to model cancer patients because of the large number of variables that impact each patient's outcome trajectory, including genotypic, phenotypic, social, and environmental factors. However, the path to digital twins in radiation oncology is becoming possible due to recent progress, such as multiscale modeling techniques that estimate patient-specific cellular, molecular, and histological distributions, and modern cryptographic techniques that enable secure and efficient centralization of patient data across multiple institutions. With these and other future scientific advances, digital twins for radiation oncology will likely become feasible. This work discusses the likely generalized architecture of patient-specific digital twins and digital twin networks, as well as the benefits, existing barriers, and potential gateways to the application of digital twin technology in radiation oncology."

Existing sequential learning-based methods have shown promising results. However, these methods may fail to capture global features. Due to its inherent ability to learn interconnected data, graph-based methods can address this gap. In this paper, we present a new graph-based hierarchical attention network (GHAN) that uses a graph convolutional neural network with an ordinal loss to improve suicide risk identification on social media. Specifically, GHAN first captures global features by constructing three graphs to capture semantic, syntactic, and sequential contextual information. Then encoded textual features are fed to attentive transformers’ encoder and optimized to factor in the increasing suicide risk levels using an ordinal classification layer hierarchically for suicide risk detection. Experimental results show that the proposed GHAN outperformed state-of-the-art methods on a public Reddit dataset."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the situations that arouse out of the pandemic were so incongruous to the world we knew that even factual statements often had a humorous reaction. In this paper, we present a dataset of 2510 samples hand-annotated with labels such as humor style, type, theme, target and stereotypes formed or exploited while creating the humor in addition to 909 memes. Our dataset comprises Reddit posts, comments, Onion news headlines, real news headlines, and tweets. We evaluate the task of humor detection and maladaptive humor detection on state-of-the-art models namely RoBERTa and GPT-3. The finetuned models trained on our dataset show significant gains over zero-shot models including GPT-3 when detecting humor. Even though GPT-3 is good at generating meaningful explanations, we observed that it fails to detect maladaptive humor due to the absence of overt targets and profanities. We believe that the presented dataset will be helpful in designing computational methods for topical humor processing as it provides a unique sample set to study the theory of incongruity in a post-pandemic world.

In this work, we conduct a case study approaching this problem with semi-supervised learning using a large language model (LLM). We select Reddit as the target social media platform due to its broad coverage of topics and content types. Our pipeline first generates weak financial sentiment labels for Reddit posts with an LLM and then uses that data to train a small model that can be served in production. We find that prompting the LLM to produce Chain-of-Thought summaries and forcing it through several reasoning paths helps generate more stable and accurate labels, while training the student model using a regression loss further improves distillation quality. With only a handful of prompts, the final model performs on par with existing supervised models. Though production applications of our model are limited by ethical considerations, the model’s competitive performance points to the great potential of using LLMs for tasks that otherwise require skill-intensive annotation."

To address these limitations, this study proposes a text classification approach to identify tweets indicating a user’s intent or status on vaccination. A comparative analysis between the proportions of tweets from different categories and real-world vaccination data reveals notable alignment, suggesting that tweets may serve as a precursor to actual vaccination status. Further, regression analysis and time series forecasting were performed to explore the potential of tweet data, demonstrating the significance of incorporating tweet data in predicting future vaccination status. Finally, clustering was applied to the tweet sets with positive and negative labels to gain insights into underlying focuses of each stance."

This abundance of human interaction makes SM particularly attractive for social sensing. Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums, users post information and encourage others to support their side, using symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless, the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals’ stances. We analyze users’ attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines."

One such structure, the Ego Network Model (ENM), has been found almost ubiquitously in human society. Recently, this model has been extended to include signed connections. While the unsigned ENM has been rigorously observed for decades, the signed version is still somewhat novel and lacks the same breadth of observation. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to examine this signed structure across various categories of individuals from a swathe of culturally distinct regions. Minor differences in the distribution of signs across the SENM can be observed between cultures. However, these can be overwhelmed when the network is centred around a specific topic. Indeed, users who are engaged with specific themes display higher levels of negativity in their networks. This effect is further supported by a significant negative correlation between the number of \"general\" topics discussed in a network and that network’s percentage of negative connections. These findings suggest that the negativity of communications and relationships on Twitter are very dependent on the topics being discussed and, furthermore, these relationships are more likely to be negative when they are based around a specific topic."

Beyond observing an improvement of over 9% (in Pearson r) when using Twitter language over demographics to predict community-level pain, our study reveals that the discourse on pain varied significantly across communities in the United States. Evangelical Hubs frequently post about God, lessons from struggle, and prayers when expressing pain, whereas Working Class Country posts about regret and extreme endurance. Academic stresses, injuries, painkillers, and surgeries were the most commonly discussed pain themes in College Towns; Graying America discussed therapy, used emotional language around empathy and anger, and posted about chronic pain treatment; the African American South posted about struggles, patience, and faith when talking about pain.

They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption.

However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic Volatility Model (ISVM) on a very recent dataset covering BTC options on the popular trading platform Deribit. Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we apply this integrated time-regime clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC options. We demonstrate that MR-ISVM contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order characteristics of option pricing models. This allows us to price the market based on the expectations of its participants in an adaptive fashion and put the procedure to action on a new dataset covering previously unexplored DA dynamics."

The Accord Project provides an open-source SLC framework containing three main modules: Cicero, Concerto, and Ergo. Currently, we need lawyers, programmers, and clients to work together with great effort to create a usable SLC using the Accord Project. This paper proposes a pipeline to automate the SLC creation process with several Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to convert law contracts to the Accord Project’s Concerto model. After evaluating the proposed pipeline, we discovered that our NER pipeline accurately detects CiceroMark from Accord Project template text with an accuracy of 0.8. Additionally, our Question Answering method can extract one-third of the Concerto variables from the template text. We also delve into some limitations and possible future research for the proposed pipeline. Finally, we describe a web interface enabling users to build SLCs. This interface leverages the proposed pipeline to convert text documents to Smart Legal Contracts by using NLP models."

To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge graph construction, we design multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good quality with very few questions. The question answering system also employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness, to help improve extraction quality. To improve system efficiency, we utilize a few query-driven techniques for web-based question answering to reduce the runtime and provide fast responses to user queries.

However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations. We demonstrate our automated approach on several large ontologies from the oceanographic domain and show its agreement with a manual evaluation by domain experts and its superiority over the state-of-the-art."

This faces two major challenges: (i) it is difficult to capture all the information from the QA in the WG, and (ii) the WG contains some irrelevant nodes from the KG. To address these, we propose GrapeQA with two simple improvements on the WG: (i) Prominent Entities for Graph Augmentation identifies relevant text chunks from the QA pair and augments the WG with corresponding latent representations from the LM, and (ii) Context-Aware Node Pruning removes nodes that are less relevant to the QA pair. We evaluate our results on OpenBookQA, CommonsenseQA and MedQA-USMLE and see that GrapeQA shows consistent improvements over its LM + KG predecessor (QA-GNN in particular) and large improvements on OpenBookQA."

In this paper, we study the impact of prompt syntax on the knowledge retrieval capacity of LLMs. We use a template-based approach to paraphrase simple prompts into prompts with a more complex grammatical structure. We then analyse the LLM performance for these structurally different but semantically equivalent prompts. Our study reveals that simple prompts work better than complex forms of sentences. The performance across the syntactical variations for simple relations (1:1) remains best, with a marginal decrease across different typologies. These results reinforce that simple prompt structures are more effective for knowledge retrieval in LLMs and motivate future research into the impact of prompt syntax on various tasks."

This can seriously hinder the widespread deployment of the metaverse. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) is a solution to the above problems. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm with privacy-preserving features designed for a large number of edge devices. Federated learning for metaverse (FL4M) will be a powerful tool. Because FL allows edge devices to participate in training tasks locally using their own data, computational power, and model-building capabilities. Applying FL to the metaverse not only protects the data privacy of participants but also reduces the need for high computing power and high memory on servers. Until now, there have been many studies about FL and the metaverse, respectively. In this paper, we review some of the early advances of FL4M, which will be a research direction with unlimited development potential. We first introduce the concepts of metaverse and FL, respectively. Besides, we discuss the convergence of key metaverse technologies and FL in detail, such as big data, communication technology, the Internet of Things, edge computing, blockchain, and extended reality. Finally, we discuss some key challenges and promising directions of FL4M in detail. In summary, we hope that our up-to-date brief survey can help people better understand FL4M and build a fair, open, and secure metaverse."

For this, research published at TempWeb covers (and has covered in its previous editions) the full spectrum of longitudinal studies using web content. This ranges from “low-level” network analysis (e.g., Internet traffic) and graph analysis (e.g., in social media) up to “high-level” content and concept analysis ranging from micro-content (e.g., tweets) up to entire web archives. As such, TempWeb has become a potential object of longitudinal studies on its own. Aiming at the investigation of infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Web scale, TempWeb has developed as a forum for a community from science and industry. Since longitudinal aspects in web content analysis is becoming more and more relevant for analysts from various domains, the studies, tools, and demonstrations are not only relevant for computer science, but also potentially interesting for sociology, marketing, environmental studies, politics, etc. Keeping up with its “tradition”, the current edition covers again the full spectrum of temporal Web analytics at various levels of granularity."

A more reliable way to discover new content is to periodically re-crawl the target sites. Designing such “content discovery crawlers” has important applications, for example, in web search, digital assistants, business, humanitarian aid, and law enforcement. Existing approaches assume that each site of interest has a relatively small set of unknown “source pages” that, when refreshed, frequently provide hyperlinks to the majority of new content. The state of the art (SOTA) uses ideas from the multi-armed bandit literature to explore candidate sources while simultaneously exploiting known good sources. We observe, however, that the SOTA uses a sub-optimal algorithm for balancing exploration and exploitation. We trace this back to a mismatch between the space of actions that the SOTA algorithm models and the space of actions that the crawler must actually choose from. Our proposed approach, the Thompson crawler (named after the Thompson sampler that drives its refresh decisions), addresses this shortcoming by more faithfully modeling the action space. On a dataset of 4,070 source pages drawn from 53 news domains over a period of 7 weeks, we show that, on average, the Thompson crawler discovers 20% more new pages, finds pages 6 hours earlier, and uses 14 fewer refreshes per 100 pages discovered than the SOTA."

To further examine how the COVID-19 mobility policy might influence cultural interest changes, we propose a new regression discontinuity design that has the additional potential to predict the recovery phase of peoples’ cultural product interests. By analyzing the 1592 search interest time series in 6 countries, we found different patterns of change in interest in movies, music, and art during the COVID-19 pandemic, but a clear overall incremental increase. Across the six countries we studied, we found that changes in interest in cultural products were found to be strongly correlated with mobility and that as mobility declined, interest in movies, music, and art increased by an average of 35, 27 and 20, respectively, with these changes lasting at least eight weeks."

However, existing community search approaches in temporal networks have two main limitations: (1) they adopt pre-defined subgraph patterns to model communities, which cannot find communities that do not conform to these patterns in real-world networks, and (2) they only use the aggregation of disjoint structural information to measure quality, missing the dynamic of connections and temporal properties. In this paper, we propose a query-driven Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CS-TGN) that can capture flexible community structures by learning from the ground-truth communities in a data-driven manner. CS-TGN first combines the local query-dependent structure and the global graph embedding in each snapshot of the network and then uses a GRU cell with contextual attention to learn the dynamics of interactions and update node embeddings over time. We demonstrate how this model can be used for interactive community search in an online setting, allowing users to evaluate the found communities and provide feedback. Experiments on real-world temporal graphs with ground-truth communities validate the superior quality of the solutions obtained and the efficiency of our model in both temporal and interactive static settings."

This paper proposes a novel approach to timeline summarization using Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs), a graphical representation of the text where the nodes are semantic concepts and the edges denote relationships between concepts. With AMR, sentences with different wordings, but similar semantics, have similar representations. To make use of this feature for timeline summarization, a two-step sentence selection method that leverages features extracted from both AMRs and the text is proposed. First, AMRs are generated for each sentence. Sentences are then filtered out by removing those with no named-entities and keeping the ones with the highest number of named-entities. In the next step, sentences to appear in the timeline are selected based on two scores: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of AMR nodes combined with the score obtained by applying a keyword extraction method to the text. Our experimental results on the TLS-Covid19 test collection demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach."

We used a heterogeneous dataset consisting of four web archive collections, each with varying degrees of content drift. We were able to recover a small number of webpages previously thought to have been lost and analyzed their content and evolution. Our analysis yielded three types of lost webpages: 1) those that are not recoverable (with three subtypes), 2) those that are fully recoverable, and 3) those that are partially recoverable. The analysis presented here attempts to establish clear definitions and boundaries between the different degrees of webpage recoverabilty. By using a few simple methods, web archivists could discover the new locations of web content that was previously deemed lost, and include them in future crawling efforts, and lead to more complete web archives with less content drift."

In the 21st century, influence campaigns have rapidly evolved, taking on new online identities. Many of these propaganda campaigns are persistent and well-resourced, making their identification and removal both hard and expensive. Social media companies have predominantly aimed to counter the threat of online propaganda by prioritizing the moderation of \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\". This strategy focuses on identifying orchestrated campaigns explicitly intended to deceive, rather than individual social media accounts or posts. In this paper, we study the Twitter footprint of a multi-year influence campaign linked to the Russian government. Drawing from the influence model, a generative model that describes the interactions between networked Markov chains, we demonstrate how temporal correlations in the sequential decision processes of individual social media accounts can reveal coordinated inauthentic activity."

Still, recently, some programming-related subreddits of Reddit have become a standing stone for questions and discussions. This work investigates the developers’ behavior and community formation around the twenty most popular programming languages. We examined two consecutive years of programming-related questions from Stack Overflow and Reddit, performing a longitudinal study on users’ posting activity and their high-order interaction patterns abstracted via hypergraphs. Our analysis highlighted crucial differences in how these Q&A platforms are utilized by their users.

Along with this, we aim to analyze social media posts so as to track the public opinion before and after the introduction of ordinances. Challenges include addressing concepts changing over time and infusing subtle human reasoning in mining, which we aim to address by harnessing terminology evolution methods and commonsense knowledge sources, respectively. We aim to make the results of the historical ordinance mining and event-driven analysis seamlessly accessible, relying on a robust semantic understanding framework to flexibly support web QA."

By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network metrics that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the metric-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system. This approach represents a preliminary step in the automation of AFC and AML processes, serving the purpose of facilitating the work of AFC officers by providing them with a top-down view of the picture emerging from financial data."

Besides the difficult and tedious processes that take a lot of time and energy, repo traders need to keep up to date with various laws, regulations, and financial trends that may affect their job, worsened by the exposure to a variety of market risks. As the leader of the FinTech industry, Ant Group launched a new initiative to alleviate the affliction of the repo traders at MyBank1. By leveraging many existing platform technologies, such as AI ChatBot and forecasting platforms, and with the collective work of various engineering groups, we are able to create a ChatBot that communicates with other human traders in natural language and create electronic contracts based on the negotiated terms, equipped with proper trading strategies based on forecasting results. The fully automatic workflow not only frees our trader from tedious routines, but also reduces potential human errors. At the same time, it enables refined portfolio and risk management, while opening up the possibility to apply neural network-based trading strategies, and yielding greater returns comparing to traditional workflow reliant on human experiences. Our system has evolved beyond just providing services to our own traders, to now a fully commercialized product, covering other types of interbank trading."

In vehicular Metaverse applications, avatars are digital representations of on-board users to obtain and manage immersive vehicular services (i.e., avatar tasks) in Metaverses and the data they generate. However, traditional Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data management solutions have serious data security risks and privacy protection. Fortunately, blockchain-based Web 3.0 enables avatars to have an ownership identity to securely manage the data owned by users in a decentralized and transparent manner. To ensure users’ immersive experiences and securely manage their data, avatar tasks often require significant computing resources. Therefore, it is impractical for the vehicles to process avatar tasks locally, massive computation resources are needed to support the avatar tasks. To this end, offloading avatar tasks to nearby RoadSide Units (RSUs) is a promising solution to avoid computation overload. To ensure real-time and continuous Metaverse services, the avatar tasks should be migrated among the RSUs when the vehicle navigation. It is challenging for the vehicles to independently decide whether migrate or not according to current and future avatar states. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new avatar task migration framework for vehicular Metaverses. We then formulate the avatar task migration problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and apply a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) algorithm to dynamically make migration decisions for avatar tasks. Numerous results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines for avatar task migration and enables immersive vehicular Metaverse services."

To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings. Finally, we explore several challenges and issues in this promising area."

Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM) is the task of finding useful patterns that statistically occur more often from databases for one class than for another. The existing SSPM task does not consider the weight of each item. While in the real world, the significant level of different items/objects is various. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the Weighted Statistically Significant Patterns Mining (WSSPM) problem and propose a novel WSSpm algorithm to successfully solve it. We present a new framework that effectively mines weighted statistically significant patterns by combining the weighted upper-bound model and the multiple hypotheses test. We also propose a new weighted support threshold that can satisfy the demand of WSSPM and prove its correctness and completeness. Besides, our weighted support threshold and modified weighted upper-bound can effectively shrink the mining range. Finally, experimental results on several real datasets show that the WSSpm algorithm performs well in terms of execution time and memory storage."

To overcome these problems, an efficient, lightweight, Deformable Separable Network (DSNet) is proposed for video salient object detection tasks, mainly for mobile and embedded vision applications. DSNet is equipped with a Deformable Convolution Network (DeCNet), Separable Convolution Network (SCNet), and Depth-wise Attention Response Propagation (DARP) module, which makes it maintain the trade-off between accuracy and latency. The proposed model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in unconstrained scenarios (such as partial occlusion, deformable background/objects, and illumination effect).

We also study patterns in narratives that crossover from online to offline environments, or vice versa. From a geospatial analysis, we find that offline propaganda is geographically widespread in the United States, with a slight tendency toward Northeastern states. Propaganda that spreads the farthest and lasts the longest has a patriotic framing and is short, memorable, and repeatable. Through text comparison methods, we illustrate that online propaganda typically leads the appearance of the same propaganda in offline flyers, banners, and graffiti.

In this paper, we leverage a public repository of fact-checked claims to build a methodological framework for automatically identifying false and unsubstantiated claims spreading on Twitter in February 2022. Our framework consists of two sequential models: First, the claim detection model identifies whether tweets incorporate a (false) claim among those considered in our collection. Then, the claim retrieval model matches the tweets with fact-checked information by ranking verified claims according to their relevance with the input tweet. Both models are based on pre-trained language models and fine-tuned to perform a text classification task and an information retrieval task, respectively. In particular, to validate the effectiveness of our methodology, we consider 83 verified false claims that spread on Twitter during the first week of the invasion, and manually annotate 5,872 tweets according to the claim(s) they report. Our experiments show that our proposed methodology outperforms standard baselines for both claim detection and claim retrieval. Overall, our results highlight how social media providers could effectively leverage semi-automated approaches to identify, track, and eventually moderate false information that spreads on their platforms."

As technology democratizes over time, there is an increasing fear that novice users can create Deepfakes, to discredit others and undermine public discourse. In this paper, we conduct user studies to understand whether participants with advanced computer skills and varying level of computer science expertise can create Deepfakes of a person saying a target statement using limited media files. We conduct two studies; in the first study (n = 39) participants try creating a target Deepfake in a constrained time frame using any tool they desire. In the second study (n = 29) participants use pre-specified deep learning based tools to create the same Deepfake. We find that for the first study, of the participants successfully created complete Deepfakes with audio and video, whereas for the second user study, of the participants were successful in stitching target speech to the target video. We further use Deepfake detection software tools as well as human examiner-based analysis, to classify the successfully generated Deepfake outputs as fake, suspicious, or real. The software detector classified of the Deepfakes as fake, whereas the human examiners classified of the videos as fake. We conclude that creating Deepfakes is a simple enough task for a novice user given adequate tools and time; however, the resulting Deepfakes are not sufficiently real-looking and are unable to completely fool detection software as well as human examiners."

On the other hand, the processing of user data requires compliance with privacy policies. This paper proposes a privacy–preserving Federated Learning (FL) framework for online content moderation that incorporates Central Differential Privacy (CDP). We simulate the FL training of a classifier for detecting tweets with harmful content, and we show that the performance of the FL framework can be close to the centralized approach. Moreover, it has a high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number of tweets) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of clients (from fifty to ten) or the tweets per client (from 1K to 100), the classifier can still achieve AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to four other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior and still obtain a promising performance (61% – 80% AUC)."

Finding groups of nodes that form strongly stable agreements and participate in collective conflicts with other groups is an important problem in this context. Previous works approach this problem by finding balanced subgraphs, in which the polarity measure is optimized, that result in large subgraphs without a clear notion of agreement or conflict. In real-world signed networks, balanced subgraphs are often not polarized as in the case of a subgraph with only positive edges. To remedy this issue, we leverage the notion of cohesion — we find pairs of cohesively polarized communities where each node in a community is positively connected to nodes in the same community and negatively connected to nodes in the other community. To capture the cohesion along with the polarization, we define a new measure, dichotomy. We leverage the balanced triangles, which model the cohesion and polarization at the same time, to design a heuristic that results in good seedbeds for polarized communities in real-world signed networks. Then, we introduce the electron decomposition which finds cohesively polarized communities with high dichotomy score. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we show that our method finds cohesively polarized communities and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with respect to several measures. Moreover, our algorithm is more efficient than the existing methods and practical for large-scale networks."

We discovered that a high number of accounts posting in Tagalog were suspended as part of Twitter’s crackdown on interference operations after the 2016 US Presidential election. By combining text embedding and transfer learning, our framework can detect, with promising accuracy, malicious users posting in Tagalog without any prior knowledge or training on malicious content in that language. We first learn an embedding model for each language, namely a high-resource language (English) and a low-resource one (Tagalog), independently. Then, we learn a mapping between the two latent spaces to transfer the detection model. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and yields marked advantages in settings with very limited training data—the norm when dealing with detecting malicious activity in online platforms."

Many modern e-commerce integrity systems utilize machine learning (ML) to detect fraud and bad actors. We discuss the practical problems faced by integrity systems which utilize data associated with user interactions with the platform. Specifically, we focus on the challenge of representing the user interaction events, and aggregating their features. We compare the performance of two paradigms to handle the feature temporality when training the ML models: hand-engineered temporal aggregation and a learned aggregation using a sequence encoder. We show that a model which learns a time-aggregation using a sequence encoder outperforms models trained on handcrafted aggregations on the fraud classification task with a real-world dataset."

We are witnessing a rise in online hate groups, inspiring the impressionable and vulnerable population towards extreme actions in the real world. In this paper, we study the spread of hate sentiments in online forums by collecting 1,973 long comment threads (30+ comments per thread) posted on dark-web forums and containing a combination of benign posts and radical comments on the Islamic religion. This framework allows us to leverage network analysis tools to investigate sentiment propagation through a social network. By combining sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and graph theory, we aim to shed light on the propagation of hate speech in online forums and the extent to which such speech can influence individuals. The results of the intra-thread analysis suggests that sentiment tends to cluster within comment threads, with around 75% of connected members sharing similar sentiments. They also indicate that online forums can act as echo chambers where people with similar views reinforce each other’s beliefs and opinions. On the other hand, the inter-thread shows that 64% of connected threads share similar sentiments, suggesting similarities between the ideologies present in different threads and that there likely is a wider network of individuals spreading hate speech across different forums. Finally, we plan to study this work with a larger dataset, which could provide further insights into the spread of hate speech in online forums and how to mitigate it."

Although reactive predator detection methods have been studied, proactive victim protection and crime prevention can also be achieved through vulnerability analysis of potential youth victims. Despite its significance, vulnerability analysis has not been thoroughly studied in the data science literature, while several social science studies used survey-based methods. To address this gap, we investigate humans’ social-psychological traits and quantify key vulnerability factors to cybergrooming by analyzing text features in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Through pairwise correlation studies, we demonstrate the degrees of key vulnerability dimensions to cybergrooming from youths’ conversational features. Our findings reveal that victims have negative correlations with family and community traits, contrasting with previous social survey studies that indicated family relationships or social support as key vulnerability factors. We discuss the current limitations of text mining analysis and suggest cross-validation methods to increase the validity of research findings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into understanding the vulnerability factors to cybergrooming and highlights the importance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches."

The computational methods used in social network analysis have opened the way for new approaches to be used to understand the psychological and social processes that occur when users take part in online social movements or digital activism. The research in this paper takes an interdisciplinary approach bridging social identity and deindividuation theories to show how shared, individual social identities merge into a collective identity using computational techniques. We demonstrate a novel approach to evaluating the emergence of collective identity by measuring: 1) the statistical similarity of discussion topics within online communities and 2) the strength of these communities by examining network modularity and assortative properties of the network. To accomplish this, we examined the online connective action campaign of the #stopthesteal movement that emerged during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Our dataset consisted of 838,395 tweets posted by 178,296 users collected from January 04, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The results show that the network becomes more cohesive and topic similarity increases within communities leading up to and just after the elections (event 1) and the U.S. Capitol riot (event 2). Taking this multi-method approach of measuring content and network structure over time helps researchers and social scientists understand the emergence of a collective community as it is being constructed. The use of computational methods to study collective identity formation can help researchers identify the behaviors and social dynamics emerging from this type of cyber-collective movement that often serve as catalysts for these types of events. Finally, this research offers a new way to assess the psycho-social drivers of participant behaviors in cyber collective action."

In this paper, we analyze the Twitter traffic related to the US 2020 pre-election debate and ask whether it mirrors the electoral system. The U.S. electoral system provides that, regardless of the actual vote gap, the premier candidate who received more votes in one state ‘takes’ that state. Criticisms of this system have pointed out that election campaigns can be more intense in particular key states to achieve victory, so-called swing states. Our intuition is that election debate may cause more traffic on Twitter-and probably be more plagued by misinformation-when associated with swing states. The results mostly confirm the intuition. About 88% of the entire traffic can be associated with swing states, and links to non-trustworthy news are shared far more in swing-related traffic than the same type of news in safe-related traffic. Considering traffic origin instead, non-trustworthy tweets generated by automated accounts, so-called social bots, are mostly associated with swing states. Our work sheds light on the role an electoral system plays in the evolution of online debates, with, in the spotlight, disinformation and social bots."

Such attacks promote certain keywords to push them to Twitter trends to make them visible to a broader audience. Past work on such fake trends revealed a new astroturfing attack named ephemeral astroturfing that employs a very unique bot behavior in which bots post and delete generated tweets in a coordinated manner. As such, it is easy to mass-annotate such bots reliably, making them a convenient source of ground truth for bot research. In this paper, we detect and disclose over 212,000 such bots targeting Turkish trends, which we name astrobots. We also analyze their activity and suspension patterns. We found that Twitter purged those bots en-masse 6 times since June 2018. However, the adversaries reacted quickly and deployed new bots that were created years ago. We also found that many such bots do not post tweets apart from promoting fake trends, which makes it challenging for bot detection methods to detect them. Our work provides insights into platforms’ content moderation practices and bot detection research. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/tugrulz/EphemeralAstroturfing."

In this paper, we present an approach to detect propagandas and the associated emotional and psychological aspects from social media news headlines that contain such a contextualized cyber social attack. We created a new dataset of headlines containing propaganda tweets and another dataset of potential emotions that the audience might endure when being exposed to such propaganda headlines.

For example, at the beginning of 2022 a €2.7B civil lawsuit was launched against Meta on the basis that it has abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on UK users in order to exploit their personal data. Data centralisation can lead to a number of problems including: lock-in/siloing effects, lack of user control over their personal data, limited incentives and opportunities for interoperability and openness, and the resulting detrimental effects on privacy and innovation. A number of diverse approaches and technologies exist for decentralising data, such as federated querying and distributed ledgers. The main question is, though, what does decentralisation really mean for web data and Knowledge Graphs? What are the main issues and tradeoffs involved?

It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). We implemented our approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric."

On the one hand, current centralized approaches are plagued by issues such as lack of privacy and control for users, high costs, and bad performance, making these approaches unsuitable for the decentralized data spaces prevalent in Europe and various industries (decentralized on the conceptual and physical levels while centralized in the underlying implementation). On the other hand, decentralized systems face challenges with limited knowledge of/control over the global system, fair resource utilization, and data provenance. Our proposed Semantic Data Ledger (SDL) approach combines the advantages of both architectures to overcome their limitations. SDL allows users to choose the best combination of centralized and decentralized features, providing a decentralized infrastructure for the publication of structured data with machine-readable semantics. It supports expressive structured queries, secure data sharing, and payment mechanisms based on an underlying autonomous ledger, enabling the implementation of economic models and fair-use strategies."

The use of data spaces, where data is exchanged among members in a self-regulated environment, is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current manual practices of managing metadata and vocabularies in these spaces are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the needs of all stakeholders. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we believe that semantic interoperability in data spaces can be significantly improved. This involves automatically generating and updating metadata, which results in a more flexible vocabulary that can accommodate the diverse terminologies used by different sub-communities. Our vision for the future of data spaces addresses the limitations of conventional data exchange and makes data more accessible and valuable for all members of the community."

However, due to the recent trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, several frameworks have been proposed such as Model Cards, and Data Cards, among others, to help in the appropriate re-usage of those models and datasets. In addition, because of the introduction of the dataspace concept for similar datasets in one place, there is potential that similar Model Cards, Data Cards, Service Cards, and Dataspace Cards can be linked to extract helpful information for better decision-making about which model and data can be used for a specific application. This paper reviews the case for considering a Semantic Web approach for exchanging Model/Data Cards as Linked Data or knowledge graphs in a dataspace, making them machine-readable. We discuss the basic concepts and propose a schema for linking Data Cards and Model Cards within a dataspace. In addition, we introduce the concept of a dataspace card which can be a starting point for extracting knowledge about models and datasets in a dataspace. This helps in building trust and reuse of models and data among companies and individuals participating as publishers or consumers of such assets."

Common reference dataspace architectures assume that sources publish their own domain-specific schema. These schemas, also known as semantic models, can only be partially created automatically and require oversight and refinement by human modellers. Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine. We discuss how PLASMA as a tool is suitable for building semantic models by non-expert users in the context of dataspaces and show some applications where PLASMA has already been used in data management projects."

Digital platforms have emerged as an effective mechanism for enabling the management and sharing of data from various companies. To enable sharing of data beyond the platform boundaries, definition of new platform federation approaches is on the rise. This makes enabling the federation of digital platforms a key requirement for large-scale dataspaces. Therefore, the identification of platform federation requirements and building blocks for such dataspaces needs to be systematically addressed. In this paper, we try to systematically explore the high-level requirements for enabling a federation of digital platforms in the manufacturing domain and identify a set of building blocks. We integrate the requirements and building blocks into the notion of dataspaces. The identified requirements and building blocks act as a blueprint for designing and instantiating new dataspaces, thereby speeding up the development process and reducing costs. We present a case study to illustrate how the use of common building blocks can act as common guiding principles and result in more complete and interoperable implementations."

Our technique computes a sample of provenance based on the distribution of provenance wrt the query result that is estimated from the distribution of input data while considering the correlation among the data.

Data cleaning is a crucial step in improving the quality of data. Still, it is equally important to document the steps made during the data cleaning process to ensure transparency and enable others to assess the quality of the resulting data. While provenance models such as W3C PROV have been introduced to track changes and events related to any entity, their use in documenting the provenance of data-cleaning workflows can be challenging, particularly when mixing different types of documents or entities in the model. To address this, we propose a conceptual model and analysis that breaks down data-cleaning workflows into process abstraction and workflow recipes, refining operations to the column level. This approach provides users with detailed provenance information, enabling transparency, auditing, and support for data cleaning workflow improvements. Our model has several features that allow static analysis, e.g., to determine the minimal input schema and expected output schema for running a recipe, to identify which steps violate the column schema requirement constraint, and to assess the reusability of a recipe on a new dataset. We hope that our model and analysis will contribute to making data processing more transparent, accessible, and reusable."

We demonstrate the applicability of this model and show how the model can be used to answer some provenance-related research questions. However, many important provenance questions in the Lattice QCD community require extensions of this provenance model. To this end, we propose a multi-layered provenance approach that combines prospective and retrospective elements."

To assist organisations, processes and standards are being defined to manage these compliance obligations. They typically rely on a notion of Environmental Management System (EMS), defined as a reflective framework allowing organisations to set and manage their goals, and demonstrate they follow due processes in order to comply with prevailing regulations. The importance of these obligations can be highlighted by the fact that failing to comply may lead to significant liabilities for organisations. An EMS framework, typically structured as a set of documents and spreadsheets, contains a record of continuously evolving regulations, teams, stakeholders, actions and updates. However, the maintainance of an EMS is often human driven, and therefore is error prone despite the meticulousness of environmental officers, and further requires external human auditing to check their validity. To avoid green washing, but also to contain the burden and cost of compliance, it is desirable for these claims to be checked by trusted automated means. Provenance is ideally suited to track the changes occurring in an EMS, allowing queries to determine precisely which compliance objective is prevailing at any point in time, whether it is being met, and who is responsible for it. Thus, this paper has a dual aim: first, it investigates the benefits of provenance for EMS, second, it presents the application of an emerging approach “Provenance-By-Design”, which automatically converts a specification of an EMS data model and its provenance to a data backend, a service for processing and querying of EMS provenance data, a client-side library to interact with such a service, and a simple user interface allowing developers to navigate the provenance. The application of a Provenance-By-Design approach to EMS applications results in novel opportunities for a provenance-based EMS; we present our preliminary reflection on their potential."

Choosing a final model requires DL model selection, which involves analyzing data from several training configurations (e.g. hyperparameters and DNN architectures). Tracing training data back to pre-processing operations can provide insights into the model selection step. Provenance is a natural solution to represent data derivation of the whole DL life cycle. However, there are challenges in providing an integration of the provenance of these different steps. There are a few approaches to capturing and integrating provenance data from the DL life cycle, but they require that the same provenance capture solution is used along all the steps, which can limit interoperability and flexibility when choosing the DL environment. Therefore, in this work, we present a prototype for provenance data integration using different capture solutions. We show use cases where the integrated provenance from pre-processing and training steps can show how data pre-processing decisions influenced the model selection. Experiments were performed using real-world datasets to train a DNN and provided evidence of the integration between the considered steps, answering queries such as how the data used to train a model that achieved a specific result was processed."

Also, the biomedical domain has recognised the potential of provenance capture. However, several obstacles prevent efficient, automated, and machine-interpretable enrichment of biomedical data with provenance information, such as data heterogeneity, complexity, and sensitivity. Here, we explain how in Germany clinical data are transferred from hospital information systems into a data integration centre to enable secondary use of patient data and how it can be reused as research data. Considering the complex data infrastructures in hospitals, we indicate obstacles and opportunities when collecting provenance information along heterogeneous data processing pipelines. To express provenance data, we indicate the usage of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) provenance resource for healthcare data. In addition, we consider already existing approaches from other research fields and standard communities. As a solution towards high-quality standardised clinical research data, we propose to develop a ’MInimal Requirements for Automated Provenance Information Enrichment’ (MIRAPIE) guideline. As a community project, MIRAPIE should generalise provenance information concepts to allow its world-wide applicability, possibly beyond the health care sector."

However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems."

In Brazil, the teaching and learning process in several areas has been stimulated through Academic Competitions generally called Knowledge Olympics, which are essentially student contests that aim to encourage, find talent and awaken interest in the field knowledge presented in the competition. It was precisely for this purpose that the Brazilian Investment Olympics (OBInvest) was born, aiming to democratize access to education and promote reflections on economic and financial issues, through a FL perspective for high school students from all over the country. One of OBInvest’s objectives is to help boosting the development of computational tools, aiming to provide easier access to fundamental data for decision-making in the field of finance. However, from the tools developed by OBInvest, it was noted that the creation of new educational tools would be enhanced through the use of datasets enriched with provenance and aligned with FAIR principles. This work aims to offer a computational strategy based on data science techniques, which is easy to use and also provides curated data series through a reproducible pipeline, using open data on financial reports from publicly listed Brazilian companies, provided by the Brazilian Security and Exchange Commission, called Comissão de Valores Mobiliarios (CMV). During the exploration of related works, we found just a few academic works that use CVM data with little expressive results, which motivated the development of a tool called DRE-CVM, that was supported by computational tools, with a focus on the Python language, Pandas library, the KNIME workflow platform, and Jupyter integrated development environments, running on the Anaconda3 platform over a Docker container. It’s also possible run this experiment in the Google Colabotory cloud environment. This processing it’s capable of executing reproducible pipelines and using curated, fairified, and annotated data with the retrospective source metadata of the financial statements of publicly traded Brazilian companies. The artifact uses pipelines that can be reused by students and other interested parties in finance to study the behaviors of a company’s time series results and thus introduce research on predicting future results. The last executable version of the DRE-CVM experiment can be accessed through Zenodo website at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7110653 and can be reproduced using a Docker Container available on DockerHub repository. Some improvements can be incorporated into the presented work, the main suggestions for future work are: (i) Perform more substantial analyses on the created dataset, such as predicting results based on the history of demonstration results; (ii) Recover other types of information made available by CVM, to be used during the activities of the Brazilian Investment Olympics; (iii) Adapt the docker image so that it can be executed in the My Binder cloud environment, aiming to improve reproducibility issues."

Data exchange within and across different healthcare organizations require explicit and shared semantics that biomedical ontologies and controlled vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD9, LOINC, RxNorm) have been widely implemented in the clinical decision-making systems. Aggregating heterogeneous healthcare data becomes doable which is essential for evidence-based care. Computational biomarkers can be identified by mining integrated EHR data using cutting edge machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

                "Introduction": "Knowledge graph (KG) is the backbone to enable cognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI) which depends on cognitive computing and semantic reasoning. Knowledge graph is the connected data with semantically enriched context. It is the crucial step for the next moves of AI, no matter whether the AI revolution is in designing novel deep learning algorithms or solving pressing real-world problems. Gartner predicted that knowledge graph application and graph mining will grow 100% annually to enable more complex and adaptive data science. Graph convolutional neural networks, graph transformer, graph embedding and more have achieved great performance on various downstream tasks. As the size of knowledge graph is growing exponentially, scalable graph solutions are key to store, process, and empower graph AI methods on these large-scale knowledge graphs. Furthermore, explainability, fairness, and stability of graph deep learning methods become unavoidable to enable transparent and fair decision making. Knowledge Graph day will be the main venue to bring top notch speakers from industry and academia, and create the great networking opportunities for audiences with diverse backgrounds.",

                    "Accessibility in the Metaverse": "This year’s W4A conference theme is “Accessibility in the Metaverse”. The Metaverse – the emerging ecosphere built upon web and internet platforms has become an integral part of the today’s digital society. Representing a new paradigm, the Metaverse is made up of virtual worlds developed in extended reality (XR), mixed reality (MR), virtual reality (VR) and augmentative reality (AR) technologies. The Metaverse has opened up a plethora of exciting opportunities in which accessibility and inclusive design are important attributes. As tech writer Julie Brehuescu recently wrote for The Drum, “One goal of the metaverse is to replicate the feeling of real-world connection by creating immersive virtual environments. But it may also make the internet more accessible to the more than one billion people who struggle to interact with digital content each day due to neurodivergence, disability or other impairments.” How can the Metaverse adapt to working and learning environments to ensure user needs are met quickly and efficiently? What solutions exist to encourage the autonomy and well-being of people with disabilities and older adults? What are the social, financial, cultural or ethical implications of deploying immersive web solutions without accessibility in mind?

                            "description": "Bob Metcalfe just entered his 6th career: COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEER. He’s been appointed Research Affiliate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) at MIT, his alma mater. For 11 years Bob served as Professor of Innovation at the Cockrell School of Engineering, Professor of Entrepreneurship at the McCombs School of Business, and Murchison Fellow of Free Enterprise at The University of Texas at Austin. Bob retired from UTAustin as Emeritus Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “My work here, on the Texas/Austin/UTAustin startup ecosystem, is done.” Bob was an Internet pioneer beginning in 1970 at MIT, Harvard, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), Stanford, and 3Com. He invented Ethernet at Parc on May 22, 1973. Today Ethernet is the Internet ‘ s standard plumbing, each year adding billions of ports, if we let Bob count Wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi). Bob remains a champion of Ethernet and connectivity in general, according to Metcalfe’s Law (V~N^2). The Internet turned 50 in 2019, just in time for COVID-19. The most important new fact about the human condition is that, and it ‘ s mostly good news, we are now suddenly connected. Among many other honors, Bob has won the Bell, Hopper, Japan C&C, Marconi, McCluskey, Shannon, and Stibitz Prizes. He has been inducted into the Internet, Consumer Electronics, and Computer History Museum Halls of Fame. He is Emeritus Life Trustee of MIT. Bob received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Medal of Honor in 1996 and the National Medal of Technology in 2005 for leadership in the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet. Bob founded Internet startup 3Com Corporation in Silicon Valley on June 4, 1979. 3Com went public on March 21, 1984. Bob &quot retired” from 3Com in 1990. In 1999, 3Com revenue was $5.7B, and its market capitalization peaked momentarily at an inflation-adjusted $52 billion, of which Bob didn’t even get half. 3Com was acquired by HP Enterprise in 2010. During the 1990s, Bob was CEO/Publisher/Pundit at IDG/InfoWorld Magazine. His Internet column, FROM THE ETHER, was read weekly by a million? information technologists among IDG ‘ s 90 countries. In his column he was famously wrong in predicting the Internet would suffer a gigalapse in 1996. Read all about this prediction in Bob ‘ s book, INTERNET COLLAPSES, still available on Amazon.com. During the 2000s, Bob was a limited, venture, general, and now emeritus Polaris Partner in Boston."

Following successful previous ProvenanceWeek events, this year’s instalment will again co-locate the IPAW and TaPP workshops in conjunction with WebConf 2023. IPAW and TaPP build on a successful history of provenance workshops that bring together researchers from a wide range of computer science fields including workflows, semantic web, databases, high performance computing, distributed systems, operating systems, programming languages, and software engineering, as well as researchers from other fields, such as biology and physics that have urgent provenance needs.",
                    "Provenance is increasingly important in data science, workflow systems, and many other areas, particularly to support transparency, accountability and explanations. By providing a record of the data creation process and of dependencies between data, provenance information is essential for tracing errors in transformed data back to erroneous inputs, access control, auditing, repeatability and reproducibility, evaluating data quality, and establishing ownership of data.",

With that problem in mind, we designed noWorkflow aiming at transparently and automatically capturing provenance of Python scripts. In its 10 years of existence, it has been used for different purposes. In this talk, we provide an overview of noWorkflow’s evolution throughout the years and analyze myths and truths about it. To do that, we go over the 150+ papers that cite noWorkflow and group their main claims, classifying them as myths or truths.",

                        "Abstract2": "In this talk, I introduce the audience to relevance-based data management (RBDM), a new paradigm where information about what data is \"relevant\" for producing a result of a computation, i.e., the data provenance of the computation, is used to improve management of the data, e.g., by restricting computations to what data is relevant or by making caching decisions based on relevance. I will present provenance-based data skipping (PBDS) as one example of relevance-based data management. In PBDS, a system maintains lightweight sketches of the provenance of queries based on a (virtual) horizontal partitioning of tables which are captured at query runtime. Such provenance sketches are then utilized to speed-up the evaluation of future queries, by translating them into selection conditions that can utilize the existing physical design of a databases. Additionally, I will discuss preliminary ideas on the use of relevance as an objective metric for the value of data.",

                        "Abstract1": "Database provenance tracks the relationships between input tuples and outputs of a relational query that transforms the source data into a desired view. In a seminal work by Green, Karvounarakis, and Tannen (PODS 2007), Provenance Semirings were proposed as a formal and general approach to track data provenance as annotations to tuples produced in different stages of the transformation in a query, which was later extended to aggregate operations by Amsterdamer, Deutch, and Tannen (PODS 2011). In this talk, I will give an overview of provenance semirings and describe how the powerful concept of provenance semirings has been used in our work on building tools for helping new programmers and students learn, debug, and trace relational queries. In our work, we defined and studied the complexity of the “small counterexample” problem for query debugging, built tools for relational algebra and SQL efficiently tracking provenance with user interfaces for easy exploration and understanding, and studied the effectiveness of these tools in database education for helping students debug queries in classroom settings. The \"RATest\" tool for debugging relational algebra has been successfully used by more than 1000 students in our undergraduate and graduate classes in the last few years. This is joint work with Zhengjie Miao, Jun Yang, Yihao Hu, Amir Gilad, Kristin Stephens-Martinez, and many other graduate and undergraduate students in the HNRQ project.",

This started the moment users became content creators, and has grown with the emergence of social platforms tailored to our need to connect and share with others. Throughout my work, I've come to appreciate how social media has democratized access to real-world news and social sentiment, while also witnessing the loss of trust created by fake information. As a computer scientist from Chile in Latin America, I have worked on a range of problems that were driven by local needs. Many times, I have tried to apply state of the art solutions to well-known problems, only to find that these don't work outside of their initial evaluation dataset.\nIn this talk, I'll discuss how geographical, language, and social diversity have opened new avenues for innovation and better understanding the social Web. I'll also show that to truly create useful technological solutions, we must develop inclusive research and resources.",

Repetition, alignment with pre-existing beliefs, and trusted sources make people more likely to believe information - regardless of its actual veracity. Lack of careful reasoning and relevant knowledge (eg digital or media literacy) makes people specifically more vulnerable to believing falsehoods, and thus reduces the ability to tell true from false. Furthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and what they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention, more so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, nudging social media users to focus on accuracy can reduce misinformation sharing. Finally, crowdsourced veracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.",

Who and what is creative remains largely disconnected from diverse and global cultural norms, rendering existing technology suboptimal and even unusable to the world’s majority. Creativity has long been dictated by the aesthetic taste, values, needs, concerns, and aspirations of the West. Today, India and China alone account for the majority of the world’s users. The Global South are fast shaping data systems in ways that remain underexamined and siloed as “Rest of World” among industry and government folks. With the rise of the creator economy across sectors, questions abound on creative rights, provenance, fairness, labor, and representation. This talk discusses concerns around digital labor, data materiality, media literacies, creative value, and online expression. In doing so, it sets a pathway towards designing inclusive and intersectional systems that transcend borders.",

Over the last ten years, political scientists have attempted to get their semantic act by cooperating to formalize their vocabulary. The result has been a dramatic improvement in how scholars diagnose and treat problems of democracy, as well as a set of web applications that have changed the way countries write constitutions. Nevertheless, these methods of semantic cooperation have exposed some persistent challenges of “social engineering,” ones that may have tractable web solutions.",
                    "bio": "Professor Elkins’ research focuses on issues of democracy, institutional reform, research methods, and national identity, with an emphasis on cases in Latin America. He is currently completing a book manuscript, Steal this Constitution: The Drift and Mastery of Constitutional Design, which examines the design and diffusion of democratic institutions. Much of his research is on the origins and consequences of national constitutions. With Tom Ginsburg (University of Chicago), Professor Elkins co-directs both the Comparative Constitutions Project(http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/) , a NSF-funded initiative to understand the causes and consequences of constitutional choices, and the website Constitute(https://webeditor.la.utexas.edu/profile/constituteproject.org) , which provides resources and analysis for constitutional drafters in new democracies. Elkins earned his B.A. from Yale University, an M.A. from the University of Texas at Austin, and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley."

They are commonly used to model social networks, knowledge graphs, and protein-protein interaction networks.\nIn this talk we will present the potential of graph generative models and our recent relevant efforts in the biomedical domain. More specifically we present a novel architecture that generates medical records as graphs with privacy guarantees. We capitalize and modify the graph Variational autoencoders (VAEs) architecture. We train the generative model with the well known MIMIC medical database and achieve generated data that are very similar to the real ones yet provide privacy guarantees. We also develop new GNNs for predicting antibiotic resistance and other protein related downstream tasks such as enzymes classifications and Gene Ontology classification. We achieve there as well promising results with potential for future application in broader biomedical related tasks. Finally we present future research directions for multi modal generative models involving graphs.",

                "description": "CONNECTIVITY\n\nThe most important new fact about the human condition is that we are now suddenly connected. When I say “suddenly” I refer to the Internet’s birthday, October 29, 1969 and how two thirds of the human race, five billion people, are already on the Internet, in only 50 years. Suddenly.\n\nThe Arpanet started the Internet in 1969 by networking time-shared minicomputers serving dumb character terminals. Then in 1973 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) decided to put a personal computer on every desk. Ethernet was invented on May 22, 1973 to provide local connectivity among those PCs, one on every desk, if you can imagine that..\n\nThe PARC Ethernet was formed by combining Jerrold coaxial vampire taps, Manchester on-off keying, and Alohanet randomized retransmissions. Then we wrapped it in internet protocols according to a layered reference model. Then we standardized it all: Ethernet, IP, TCP, TELNET, FTP, Mail, URL, HTML, HTTP.\n\nEthernet evolved rapidly away from its Jerrold-Manchester-Alohanet prototype. Ethernet’s legacy is instead packets to the desktop, abundance of bandwidth, and standardization. Come hear all about it. GPT is writing my lecture now.",
                "speaker_bio": "Bob Metcalfe just entered his 6th career: COMPUTATIONAL ENGINEER. He's been appointed Research Affiliate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) at MIT, his alma mater. For 11 years Bob served as Professor of Innovation at the Cockrell School of Engineering, Professor of Entrepreneurship at the McCombs School of Business, and Murchison Fellow of Free Enterprise at The University of Texas at Austin. Bob retired from UTAustin as Emeritus Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 'My work here, on the Texas/Austin/UTAustin startup ecosystem, is done.' Bob was an Internet pioneer beginning in 1970 at MIT, Harvard, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), Stanford, and 3Com. He invented Ethernet at Parc on May 22, 1973. Today Ethernet is the Internet ' s standard plumbing, each year adding billions of ports, if we let Bob count Wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi). Bob remains a champion of Ethernet and connectivity in general, according to Metcalfe's Law (V~N^2). The Internet turned 50 in 2019, just in time for COVID-19. The most important new fact about the human condition is that, and it ' s mostly good news, we are now suddenly connected. Among many other honors, Bob has won the Bell, Hopper, Japan C&C, Marconi, McCluskey, Shannon, and Stibitz Prizes. He has been inducted into the Internet, Consumer Electronics, and Computer History Museum Halls of Fame. He is Emeritus Life Trustee of MIT. Bob received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Medal of Honor in 1996 and the National Medal of Technology in 2005 for leadership in the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet. Bob founded Internet startup 3Com Corporation in Silicon Valley on June 4, 1979. 3Com went public on March 21, 1984. Bob &quot retired” from 3Com in 1990. In 1999, 3Com revenue was $5.7B, and its market capitalization peaked momentarily at an inflation-adjusted $52 billion, of which Bob didn’t even get half. 3Com was acquired by HP Enterprise in 2010. During the 1990s, Bob was CEO/Publisher/Pundit at IDG/InfoWorld Magazine. His Internet column, FROM THE ETHER, was read weekly by a million? information technologists among IDG ' s 90 countries. In his column he was famously wrong in predicting the Internet would suffer a gigalapse in 1996. Read all about this prediction in Bob ' s book, INTERNET COLLAPSES, still available on Amazon.com. During the 2000s, Bob was a limited, venture, general, and now emeritus Polaris Partner in Boston.",

The conference brings together researchers, developers, users and commercial ventures — indeed all those who are passionate about the Web and what it has to offer.",
                "The World Wide Web was first conceived in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. The first conference of the series, WWW1, was held at CERN in 1994 and organized by Robert Cailliau. The International World Wide Web Conferences Committee (IW3C2) was founded by Joseph Hardin and Robert Cailliau later in 1994 and has been responsible for the conference series ever since. Except for 1994 and 1995 when two conferences were held each year, WWW became an annual event held in late April or early May. The location of the conference rotates among America, Europe, and Asia. In 2001 the conference designator changed from a number (1 through 10) to the year it is held; i.e., WWW11 became known as WWW2002, and so on.",
                "Starting with the 2018 edition, the conference series previously known as World Wide Web Conference (WWW) has been renamed as The Web Conference or TheWebConf with a new brand and a new communication model. Until 2021, the conferences have been organized by the IW3C2 in collaboration with Local Organizing Committees and Technical Program Committees. The 2022 edition marks another important change in the history of this conference series: it is now integrated into ACM SIGWEB and will be managed by a new steering committee within ACM."
