                "proposal": "At first, making research shareable seems like an extra overhead for authors. You just had your paper accepted in a major conference; why should you spend more time on it? The answer is to have more impact!\nIf you ask any experienced researcher in academia or in industry, they will tell you that they in fact already follow the reproducibility principles on a daily basis! Not as an afterthought, but as a way of doing good research.\nMaintaining easily reproducible experiments, simply makes working on hard problems much easier by being able to repeat your analysis for different data sets, different hardware, different parameters, etc. Like other leading system designers, you will save significant amounts of time because you will minimize the set up and tuning effort for your experiments. In addition, such practices will help bring new students up to speed after a project has lain dormant for a few months.\nIdeally availability of artifacts reproducibility should be close to zero effort.",

                    "Artifact Availability & Evaluation": "Each submission should contain: (1) A prototype system provided as a white box (source, configuration files, build environment) or a black-box system fully specified. (2) Input Data: Either the process to generate the input data should be made available, or when the data is not generated, the actual data itself or a link to the data should be provided. (3) The set of experiments (system configuration and initialization, scripts, workload, measurement protocol) used to produce the raw experimental data. (4) For full reproducibility submissions, the scripts needed to transform the raw data into the graphs included in the paper. By providing the artifacts you are awarded the \"Artifacts Available\" badge. By providing artifacts that are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality and are clearly documented, well-structured, and facilitate reuse you are awarded the \"Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable\" badge.",
                    "Reproducibility": "The central results and claims of the paper should be supported by the submitted experiments, meaning we can recreate result data and graphs that demonstrate similar behavior with that shown in the paper. Typically when the results are about response times, the exact numbers will depend on the underlying hardware. We do not expect to get identical results with the paper unless it happens that we get access to identical hardware. Instead, what we expect to see is that the overall behavior matches the conclusions drawn in the paper, e.g., that a given algorithm is significantly faster than another one, or that a given parameter affects negatively or positively the behavior of a system. By having all core results reproduced by an independent reproducibility reviewer you are awarded the \"Results Reproduced\" badge.",
                    "Process": {
                        "Availability Review": "The artifacts of each paper are reviewed by one artifacts reviewer to ensure the quality of the submission. The role of the artifact availability reviewer is to compile, deploy, and test the artifacts and communicate directly with the authors for any issues face during this process. The ultimate goal is to resolve any issues so that all artifacts are made publicly available.",
                        "Reproducibility Review": "After the initial availability review phase, each paper is reviewed by one database group. The process happens in communication with the reviewers so that authors and reviewers can iron out any lingering technical issues. The end result is a short report which describes the result of the process. For successful papers the report is maintained in the Reproducibility Reports page."

                    "description": "Every case is slightly different. Sometimes the Availability & Reproducibility committee can simply rerun software (e.g., rerun some existing benchmark). At other times, obtaining raw data may require special hardware (e.g., sensors in the arctic). In the latter case, the committee will not be able to reproduce the acquisition of raw data, but then you can provide the committee with a protocol, including detailed procedures for system set-up, experiment set-up, and measurements.\nWhenever raw data acquisition can be produced, the following information should be provided.",
                    "information needed": {
                        "Environment": "Authors should explicitly specify the OS and tools that should be installed as the environment. Such specification should include dependencies with specific hardware features (e.g., 25 GB of RAM are needed) or dependencies within the environment (e.g., the compiler that should be used must be run with a specific version of the OS).",
                        "System": "System setup is one of the most challenging aspects when repeating experiments. System setup will be easier to conduct if it is automatic rather than manual. Authors should test that the system they distribute can actually be installed in a new environment. The documentation should detail every step in system setup:\n\nHow to obtain the system?\nHow to configure the environment if need be (e.g., environment variables, paths)?\nHow to compile the system? (existing compilation options should be mentioned)\nHow to use the system? (What are the configuration options and parameters to the system?)\nHow to make sure that the system is installed correctly?\nThe above tasks should be achieved by executing a set o scripts provided by the authors that will download needed components (systems, libraries), initialize the environment, check that software and hardware is compatible, and deploy the system.",
                        "Tools": "The committee strongly suggests using one of the following tools to streamline the process of reproducibility. These tools can be used to capture the environment, the input files, the expected output files, and the required libraries in a container-like suite. This will help both the authors and the evaluators to seamlessly rerun experiments under specific environments and settings. If using all these tools proves to be difficult for a particular paper, the committee will work with the authors to find the proper solution based on the specifics of the paper and the environment needed. Below is a list of the tools recommended by the SIGMOD Reproducibility Committee.\n\nDocker containers\nReproZip\nJupiter Notebook\nGitHub repositories with clearly outlined instructions in the ReadMe file\nMore tools are available here: https://reproduciblescience.org/reproducibility-directory/.",
                        "Experiments": "Given a system, the authors should provide the complete set of experiments to reproduce the paper's results. Typically, each experiment will consist of the following parts.\n\nA setup phase where parameters are configured and data is loaded.\nA running phase where a workload is applied and measurements are taken.\nA clean-up phase where the system is prepared to avoid interference with the next round of experiments.\nThe authors should document (i) how to perform the setup, running and clean-up phases, and (ii) how to check that these phases complete as they should. The authors should document the expected effect of the setup phase (e.g., a cold file cache is enforced) and the different steps of the running phase, e.g., by documenting the combination of command line options used to run a given experiment script.\n\nExperiments should be automatic, e.g., via a script that takes a range of values for each experiment parameter as arguments, rather than manual, e.g., via a script that must be edited so that a constant takes the value of a given experiment parameter.",
                        "Graphs and Plots": "For each graph in the paper, the authors should describe how the graph is obtained from the experimental measurements. The submission should contain the scripts (or spreadsheets) that are used to generate the graphs. We strongly encourage authors to provide scripts for all their graphs. The authors are free to choose from their favorite plotting tool using a tool such as Gnuplot, Matlab, Matplotlib, R, or Octave.",
                        "Ideal Reproducibility Submission": "At a minimum the authors should provide a complete set of scripts to install the system, produce the data, run experiments and produce the resulting graphs along with a detailed Readme file that describes the process step by step so it can be easily reproduced by a reviewer.\n\nThe ideal reproducibility submission consists of a master script that:\n\ninstalls all systems needed,\ngenerates or fetches all needed input data,\nreruns all experiments and generates all results,\ngenerates all graphs and plots, and finally,\nrecompiles the sources of the paper\n... to produce a new PDF for the paper that contains the new graphs.

                "Diversity and Inclusion in Database Conference Venues": "The Data Management community is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against harassment. Our initiative coordinates D&I efforts across the data management community and includes this year’s D&I chairs of SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE.\n\nFor more information, please refer to https://dbdni.github.io/\n\nPlease follow this webpage for updates on the steps we are taking to enhance the inclusivity and diversity of our conference and community. As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.\n\nIf you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or complaints, please email the SIGMOD Diversity and Inclusion Chairs: Carlo Curino (ccurino@microsoft.com) and Yael Amsterdamer (yael.amsterdamer@biu.ac.il).",
                "INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING": {
                    "description": "As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as \"the who\"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity (\"the how\"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.",
                    "Inclusion": {
                        "description": "Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions.",
                        "Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding": {
                            "Implicit assumption":"An example of database integrity constraints: \"Every person has a mother and a father.\" This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents.",
                            "Oppressive terminology":"Using the term \"Master-Slave\" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in this article.",
                            "Marginalization of URGs": "An example of attribute domains: \"The Gender attribute is either Male or Female.\" This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities.",
                            "Lack of accessibility": "Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple",
                            "Stereotyping": "Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles."
                        }
                    },
                    "Diversity": {
                        "description": "Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.",
                        "Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting": {
                            "Embracing different cultures": "Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., this article on names across different cultures.",
                            "Embracing differences in figures": "Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people.",
                            "Embracing gender diversity in pronouns": "Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including \"he/him/his,\" \"she/her/hers,\" and \"they/them/theirs\". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., \"chairperson\" or just \"chair\" instead of \"chairman,\" and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles."
                        }
                    },
                    "Responsibility": "Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see this article discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This SIGMOD Blog article also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.",

Like typical web services, DVE applications may be run on heterogeneous client devices and networks, with users expecting fast response times under 100 ms [12]. However, the resource demands of DVE applications are magnified and highly unpredictable, making it difficult to achieve such interactivity.",

In this work, we start to develop an average-case analysis of the performance of storage engines that can achieve significantly more accurate predictions than existing worst-case models. We propose a distribution-aware framework to predict the latency of diverse workloads executed on a vast number of data structures. As a case study, we use our framework to produce cost models for a diverse family of key-value storage engine tunings, and verify our models on RocksDB and WiredTiger.",

The second round of the competition will take place at the SIGMOD 2023 conference and will be a poster session. This is your opportunity to present your research to conference attendees and leading experts in data management, including the SRC committee.\n\nJudges will review the posters and speak to participants about their research. The judges will evaluate the research (quality, novelty, and significance) and the presentation of the research (poster, discussion) and select students to advance to the third round of the competition.",
                    "Third Round: Research Talk": "The judges will select students from the second round to give a short (10 min max) public presentation of their research. After each presentation, there will be a short question and answer session. Evaluations are based on the presenter’s knowledge of his/her research area, the contribution of the research, and the quality of the oral and visual presentation. At most three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate, and receive prizes.",
                    "Grand Finals": "The first-place winner in each category (undergraduate and graduate) from the SRC will advance to the SRC Grand Finals. A different panel of judges evaluates the winners of all SRCs held during the calendar year against each other via the web. Three undergraduates and three graduates will be chosen as the SRC Grand Finals winners. They are invited, along with their advisors, to the annual ACM Awards Banquet (aka Turing Awards ceremony, among other things), where they receive formal recognition."

While multiple students can co-author a single submission, If the work is collaborative with others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make clear what the student’s role was and should focus on that portion of the work.\nSubmissions must be original research that is not already published at another conference or journal (i.e., please don’t submit your dissertation summary as your abstract). One of the goals of the SRC is to give students feedback on ongoing, unpublished work.\nSee this website for full eligibility information.",

                    "What about the undergraduate poster competition?": "There won't be a separate undergraduate poster competition this year.",
                    "Can students submit in teams?": "Team projects will be accepted from Undergraduates. One person should be designated by the team to make the oral presentation, and only one person will receive the travel stipend per Undergraduate project. Only individual research is accepted from Graduate (Masters or PhD program) students: group research projects will not be considered. However, if an individual is part of a group research project and wants to participate in an SRC, they can only present their part of the research. Only they will receive the travel stipend and monetary award (should they win).",
                    "Can we submit the same manuscript as in our SIGMOD 2nd round submissions / demo submissions / some other paper that is currently under submission?": "Unfortunately not. The SRC does count as a presentation venue, and submitting the same work as will violate SIGMOD's duplicate submission policy.",
                    "I already competed in another SRC this year, can I still participate?": "You can only participate in one SRC per year. ",

This year, the subject of the contest is Approximate K-nearest-neighbor Graph Construction in high dimensional space. Teams' submissions will be judged on their performance on a multi-million-scale dataset.\n\nThe winning team will be awarded a prize of $2,000 (USD), and there will be an additional prize of $1,000 (USD) for the runner-up. Each group in the Finalists has one member eligible to receive a travel grant to attend the SIGMOD 2023 Conference. Prize money is donated by Microsoft.\n\nThis year's contest is brought to you by the DB Group at Rutgers University and the Chu Data Lab at Georgia Tech. The organizing team is made up of Dong Deng (co-chair), Xu Chu (co-chair), Chaoji Zuo, Zhizhi Wang, and Zhencan Peng.",
                "Task Overview": "For this year's contest, the task is to build an approximate K-NN Graph for a set of vectors. The approximate K-NN Graph is a directed graph with vertex set V and for each vertex v, it is connected to its approximate k nearest neighbor under one given similarity measure, such as Euclidean distance.\n\nFor this task, you are asked to construct one approximate K-NN Graph for one dataset, which contains a set of high-dimensional vectors and the distance between vectors are measured by Euclidean distance. The challenge here is to design one efficient algorithm to construct the approximate K-NN graph in a limited time.",

These symposia are both informative and entertaining; they are geared towards graduate students and junior researchers, but they often attract a broader audience. This year's SIGMOD New Researcher Symposium is on \"Advice from Early PhD to Early Career: Academia and Industry\". We have put together an exciting panel with diverse viewpoints and perspectives on how to effectively engage in such research.  The panel will begin by each panelist presenting their own experiences as well as advice from early PhD to early Career in academia and/or industry. Then there will be a moderate Q&A session followed by an open forum for the audience to ask their questions.",

Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:\n\nThere will be NO live streaming or remote participation. The event will be geared towards 100% in-person attendance at the conference venue.\nEach paper should have at least one author registered for in-person attendance and presentation.

I’ll discuss some of the challenges to the relational approach that have arisen over the years. I’ll also discuss the evolution of SQL, and offer some thoughts about how the language may continue to evolve in the future.",

The Mixed Methods Machine Learning (MXML) paradigm, starts with a user study, to understand how people behave in an everyday setting (such as shopping for groceries in a grocery store), and to identify points of friction that can be automated, or experiences that can be made more enjoyable. The study observations are mapped to interactions recorded in the system’s behavioral log data, which is the basis for the machine learned system. Mapping the study observations to the log data is a key step in directing the machine learning to solve a customer problem. The MXML system is evaluated with a follow-on user study, in addition to the traditional online A/B test, to assess whether the system is satisfying, helpful and delightful. In this talk we present the MXML paradigm, with real-world examples.",

With the demise of Moore’s Law, we are seeing a lot of interest (and start-ups with significant investments) in hardware database accelerators, exploring FPGAs, GPUs, and more. How will these impact DB system design, how will DB systems look like in the near future? Where are the hardest research challenges? What learnings from the past will guide us through these disruptions?",

                    "introduction": "The vision of collecting all of one’s personal information into one searchable database has been around at least since Vannevar Bush’s 1945 paper on the Memex System. In the late 1990’s, Gordon Bell and his colleagues at Microsoft Research built MyLifeBits, which was the first serious attempt to build such a database. Since then, technology has improved on several dimensions, making the vision much more realistic. Disks have become much cheaper and therefore storing all of the information is affordable. Mobile technology has significantly enhanced our ability to capture the experiences in our lives, and in practice we’re already leaving digital breadcrumbs about our activities. With the advent of smart glasses, we will be able to easily capture everything we see and experience with little friction. Finally, AI has advanced to the point where it’s possible to create higher-level summaries from individual pieces of raw data (e.g., photos, our movements on maps, shopping records). This panel will discuss the issues that separate the vision from current reality and focus our attention on the challenges that need to be overcome.",

                "Speaker": "Jure Leskovec (Stanford)",
                "Abstract": "The era of intelligent systems and applications is here and AI has been disrupting science and industry. The speed of change has been breathtaking. However, building AI-based solutions is hard, training Machine Learning models and putting them in production takes highly-skilled teams months if not years. There is a real need to drastically simplify machine learning workflow and bring AI closer to users, and make it accessible to a wide range of audiences. In this talk, I present Kumo, a no-code machine learning platform that enables data scientists to solve a wide range of machine learning problems over relational tables in a database in a simple declarative way. Kumo provides a SQL-like Predictive Query language that allows for declarative specification of machine learning problems in a wide array of applications from sales and marketing to customer retention and recommender systems. The key insight in Kumo is that relational schema can be represented as a heterogeneous hypergraph. Such graphs are emerging as an abstraction to represent complex data and Deep Graph Neural Networks (GNN) can then be used to learn optimal feature representation for any entity of interest. Automatic learning to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings brings several benefits: (1) automatic learning from the entire data spread across multiple relational tables (2) no manual feature engineering as the system learns optimal embeddings; (3) state-of-the-art predictive performance. Building such a distributed system for GNN training and inference poses several interesting algorithmic and data processing challenges, which we address by innovative machine learning methods and careful algorithm/architecture codesign. Kumo has already been successfully deployed at several major companies."

Samples serve as versatile summaries that can be applied directly or integrated as a component in the data analysis process. In this tutorial, I will discuss the design and applications of weighted sampling schemes, focusing on some of my favorite big ideas. The tutorial will particularly emphasize algorithmic simplicity and practicality and the context of streamed or distributed data."

                    "Abstract": "A key component of graph and relational learning methods is the computation of vector representations of the input graphs or relations. The starting point of this tutorial is that we model this computation as queries, mapping discrete relational objects into the realm of real vectors. We then survey recent works in the machine learning community on the expressive power of graph learning methods from this unifying query language perspective. Here, we consider the expressive power related to separability of inputs and to the approximation power of functions. Finally, we argue that the bridge between graph learning and query languages opens many avenues for further research."

                "Abstract": "Data summaries (a.k.a., sketches) are compact data structures that can be updated flexibly to capture certain properties of a data set. Well-known examples include set summaries (Bloom Filters) and cardinality estimators (Hyperloglog, amongst others). PODS and SIGMOD have been home to many papers on sketching, including several best paper recipients. Sketch algorithms emerged from the theoretical research community, but have found wide impact in practice. This talk will describe some of the impacts that sketches have had, from online advertising to privacy-preserving data analysis. It will consider the range of different strategies that researchers can follow to encourage the adoption of their work, and what has and has not worked for sketches."

This data life cycle encompasses databases/data management/data systems/data engineering often leveraging statistical, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods and, in many instances, using massive and heterogeneous collections of potentially noisy datasets. Such papers are expected to focus on data-intensive components of data science pipelines; and solve problems in areas of interest to our community (e.g., data curation, optimization, performance, storage, systems). Submissions are expected to describe (a) deployed solutions to data science pipelines and/or (b) fundamental experiences and insights from evaluating real-world data science problems. We expect that the related systems and/or datasets (including possibly query logs) will be accessible for the data management research community in order to promote future research directions.",

These applications stem from outside the core data management community (e.g., computer graphics, computer networking) or even from outside computer science (e.g., astronomy, finance, genomics, healthcare), but have clearly demonstrated non-trivial data-centric challenges necessitating novel systems and technologies. Therefore, papers are expected to have as the primary author a researcher or practitioner from a different research community or application area. Submissions are expected to describe (a) deployed solutions to data-intensive applications and/or (b) fundamental experiences and insights from evaluating real-world data-intensive applications. We expect that the related systems and/or datasets (including possibly query logs) will be accessible for the data management research community in order to promote future research directions.",

                "PRESENTATION AND DISSEMINATION": "All accepted papers will be treated equally in the conference proceedings, which are the persistent record of the conference. Authors of all accepted papers will have an opportunity (and in fact, barring an exceptional situation, will be expected) to disseminate their works in person as part of the conference program.\n\nThe rights of all ACM published authors are detailed at https://authors.acm.org/author-services/author-rights",
                "PROCEEDINGS AVAILABILITY": "The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.",
                "SUBMISSION GUIDELINES": "All aspects of the submission and notification process will be handled electronically. Submissions must adhere to the paper formatting instructions. All papers will be judged for quality and relevance. Submissions should be uploaded at:\nhttps://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2023\n\nOnce the paper is submitted, SIGMOD does not accept any changes in the title and/or authorship list, with the rare exception of authors having to comply with the revision requests and to acknowledge the work that someone has put in to revise a paper according to what the reviewers have requested. If such a change is warranted, the change has to be made on the submission site, and the PC chairs have to be informed through CMT, before the submission of the revised manuscript.",
                "DUPLICATE SUBMISSIONS AND NOVELTY REQUIREMENT": "Following the ACM guidelines a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2023 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected - or withdrawn at your request - from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.\n\nTo enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.\n\nEvery research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2023 must present substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more presented, or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2023 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication, along with all other relevant published work.\n\nAny violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.",
                "ACM PUBLICATIONS POLICY ON RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS": "As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.",
                "LENGTH, FILE TYPE, AND FORMATTING": "The ACM template changed in 2017. Make sure you are using the latest version.\n\nLength for submitted papers: All submitted research papers must be formatted according to the instructions below. The main content of the paper must be no more than 12 pages in length for the Regular Trackpapers and 8 pages for Special Track papers, although we allow an unlimited number of pages for the bibliography. No appendix will be allowed.\n\nLength for revised and camera ready papers: For all tracks in the SIGMOD Research papers, authors are allowed one extra page to help address reviewer comments in the revised version only. Therefore, the length of camera ready papers can be up to: 13 pages (+ unlimited references) for the Regular Track papers and 9 pages (plus unlimited references) for the Special Track papers.\n\nFile type: Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for 8.5\" x 11\" paper and no more than 10 MB in file size. (Larger files will be rejected by the submission site.) Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default configurations.\n\nFormatting: Research papers must follow the 2-column ACM Proceedings Format, using either the sample-sigconf.tex or Interim layout.docx template provided at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template for LaTeX (version 2e) or Word, respectively. If you plan to use ACM's official Overleaf template, please use the 2-column template available at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty. The margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.",
                "ANONYMITY REQUIREMENTS FOR REGULAR TRACK PAPERS": "Regular track papers are subject to double-anonymous requirement; special track papers are not subject to this requirement.\n\nEvery regular track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2023 will undergo a ''double-anonymous'' reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in (Snodgrass 2007): authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process.\n\nPC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following:\n\nAuthors' names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.\nFunding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.\nResearch group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.\nThe paper’s file name must not identify the authors of the paper.\nSource file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors’ names in the paper’s associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file.\nNote that the SIGMOD PC members and reviewers are expected to evaluate the originality of a submission and the completeness of the included literature survey. This necessarily involves PC members and reviewers carrying out their own literature search. Therefore, to avoid compromising the double-anonymous review process, we discourage online/public dissemination of pre-prints and working drafts of papers submitted to SIGMOD. In particular, to avoid reviewer bias potentially caused by de-anonymization through preprints (Bharadhwaj et al. 2020), SIGMOD does not allow submissions of papers that appear at pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, unless such servers allow authors to anonymize their papers, by at least temporarily masking their identity until the notification of accept/reject decisions.\n\nYou must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:\n\nIn our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...\nBibliography\n[1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10.\n[2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.\nThe solution is to reference one's past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity:\n\nIn previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...\nBibliography\n[1] Jane Smith, \"A Simple Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1997, pp. 1 - 10.\n[2] Jane Smith, \"A More Complicated Algorithm for ...,\" Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.\nDespite the anonymity requirements, authors should still include all relevant work of their own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal their identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.\n\nCommon sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.\n\nIt is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.",
                "ARTIFACTS and REPRODUCIBILITY": "SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.\n\nPlease include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For Regular Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:\n\n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\">\nWe recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within two weeks from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.\n\nIn the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case.",
                "INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING": "We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.\n\nPlease visit this page for many examples of both exclusionary writing to avoid and inclusive writing that celebrates diversity to consider adopting: http://2023.sigmod.org/calls_papers_inclusion_and_diversity.shtml. Authors are further encouraged to follow the tips and guidelines provided at: https://dbdni.github.io/#materials. Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Going further, also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in writing.",
                "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST": "During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition:\n\nA paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:\n\nThe PC member is a co-author of the paper.\nThe PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past ten years.\nThe PC member has been a collaborator within the past ten years.\nThe PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.\nThe author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago.\nThe PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.\nPapers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.\n\nTo identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members will be given a list of submitting authors who have indicated that they have a conflict with that PC member.",
                "REVIEWING PROCESS": "Number of reviews: Each paper will first receive at least three reviews. At the end of the first review round, if there is a broad agreement on a clear outcome, the AE may recommend accept or reject decision. If not, the submission will be invited for a revision followed by a second round of review.\n\nRebuttals: Before the discussion phase starts between reviewers and decisions are made, authors will have a few days to read the reviews and submit an optional short rebuttal. The sole purpose of the rebuttal is to clarify misunderstandings and factual errors through pointers to specific text in the submitted paper. As an example, a reviewer may have overlooked a part of the discussion in the paper and state that the paper fails to compare with a certain method; an example rebuttal will be of the form \"see Section 2.4, paragraph 3\". If no factual errors exist in the reviews, a rebuttal is not needed.\n\nRevisions: Some papers will be invited to submit a revised version of their paper. Authors will have one month to implement the revision items. The revision process is intended to be a constructive partnership between reviewers and authors. To this end, reviewers will be instructed to request revisions only in constructive scenarios with specific requests. In turn, authors bear the responsibility of attempting to meet those requests within the stated time frame, or of withdrawing the paper from submission. Common revision requests can include ''justify a crucial assumption'', ''present a real(istic) scenario where the defined problem occurs'', ''clean up notation'', ''tighten presentation'', ''compare against some relevant previous system'', ''show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or from a real system''. Revisions will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original. For all tracks, one extra content page is allowed after the first review to accommodate the requested revision items and a cover page to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revision items. Authors are encouraged to highlight parts of their revised manuscripts that are edited in a different color to ease their identification by the reviewers.",

                "introduction": "The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or nontraditional (see https://databasetheory.org/PODS).",
                "PODS Mission": "The PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques and solutions for the data management problems that continually arise in our data-driven society. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure a high level of efficiency, scalability, expressiveness, robustness, flexibility, security, and privacy, among others. The PODS community has a pivotal position in computer science research. It develops new ways of advancing data management that reflect the rich landscape of today’s data driven applications. PODS thus welcomes contributions that help to expand the breadth and the depth of the data management toolbox. The PODS community is an open space in which researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to pressing data management problems.",
                "Scope": "PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, system building, and both theoretical and experimental validation in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of both widely used and recently developed industry artifacts. At a time when computer science is increasingly data centric, it is essential to promote an active exchange of tools and techniques between PODS and other communities focused on data management. PODS thus pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\nDatabase design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints\nDatabase access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions\nData quality: Data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration\nDatabase processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing\nData analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams\nUncertainty: Incompleteness, inconsistency, ontological query answering, semi-structured data\nInteroperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access\nResponsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management",

They can be up to 8 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in an appendix that should be incorporated at submission time (online appendices are not allowed). However, such appendices will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 8 pages (without considering references) or do not cohere with the ACM proceedings style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and one author is expected to present it at the conference. PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process. This implies that submitted papers must adhere to the double-blind reviewing policy described below and, in addition, authors must provide a list of potential conflicts of interest at the moment of submission.",
                "Double-blind reviewing": "PODS 2023 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:\n\nAuthor names and institutions must be omitted.\nReferences to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.\nAcknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\nHowever, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.",

This includes latest developments in particular areas of data management and data science & engineering, as per the SIGMOD topics of interest, but also interdisciplinary topics or foundational introductions to related areas. Tutorials can come in different flavors, depending on the area covered, for instance:\n\nSurvey: must provide an in-depth survey of the chosen topic with the option of describing particular pieces of work in detail.\nHands-on lecture style: in-depth hands-on training on cutting edge systems and tools of relevance to data management and data science community.\nPrimer: a more fundamental introduction to an area less familiar to the database community that has potential impact on database research or could benefit from database support.\nA meaningful summary of open research issues on the topic should be included in all cases. Each accepted tutorial is expected to jump-start non-experts, equipping them with the crucial knowledge required to commence research on the topic.",
                "Submission Guidelines": "Tutorial proposals should be no more than six pages plus an unlimited number of pages for citations in the same format as research papers. Proposals should be submitted via CMT to the SIGMOD 2023 Tutorials track.\n\nSubmission web site: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2023Tutorial\n\nEach submission should include the following information:\n\nThe proposed tutorial title.\nThe preferred duration (1.5 or 3 hours). If both options are possible, the proposal should identify which material will be included for each length.\nAn abstract.\nEnough detail to provide a sense of both the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered.\nA comprehensive bibliography for the proposed tutorial.\nA short description of the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge for attendees.\nA very brief biography of the proposed presenter(s), along with contact information. The preferred number of authors/presenters is within 4.\nIf (part of) the tutorial material or an earlier version of it has been or will be presented elsewhere before SIGMOD 2023, the proposal should indicate those events (and dates), and describe how the current proposal differs from the previous editions.\nHands-on Tutorial: a list of hardware/software requirements and instructions to attendees.\nFor an accepted tutorial, a description paper will be included in the conference proceedings. Tutorial slides are expected to be made available to conference participants and also uploaded as supplementary material to the ACM Digital Library (linked to the tutorial description).",

In general, we solicit demonstration proposals that are inspired by real applications and showcase the most exciting new data management and data science & engineering technologies.\n\nSelection of demonstrations for presentation at SIGMOD is highly competitive. The evaluation criteria include both the audience experience and the novelty of the system. The proposal should also describe in detail what SIGMOD attendees who view the demonstration will experience. What exactly will the audience see? Will they be able to interact with the system? Is there an interesting scenario or script that the demonstrators will use to motivate the demonstration?",

The video should illustrate a good walkthrough of a use-case for the intended target user. Either in the video or in the paper authors should clearly indicate which part of the prototype is already implemented and which functionalities are to be implemented in the final submission.\n\nPriority will be given to systems that have never been demonstrated before. One of the demonstrations will be selected to receive a Best Demo award. Each demonstration proposal is to be submitted as a single PDF file and it must be no more than FOUR US letter (8.5'' x 11'') pages in length.

                    "introduction": "The SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award is for innovative and highly significant contributions of enduring value to the development, understanding, or use of data systems. The award is given annually (if there is at least one qualified candidate) and consists of a plaque plus an honorarium of $10,000. If the award is given to more than one individual, the honorarium will be split among all the recipients. The recipients will receive the awards at the annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference. Previous winners of the Innovations Award are: Michael Stonebraker (1992), James Gray (1993), Philip Bernstein (1994), David DeWitt (1995), C. Mohan (1996), David Maier (1997), Serge Abiteboul (1998), Hector Garcia- Molina (1999), Rakesh Agrawal (2000), Rudolf Bayer (2001), Patricia Selinger (2002), Donald Chamberlin (2003), Ronald Fagin (2004), Michael Carey (2005), Jeffrey Ullman (2006), Jennifer Widom (2007), Moshe Vardi (2008), Masaru Kitsuregawa (2009), Umeshwar Dayal (2010), Surajit Chaudhuri (2011), Bruce Lindasy (2012), Stefano Ceri (2013), Martin Kersten (2014), Laura Haas (2015), Gerhard Weikum (2016), and Goetz Graefe (2017), Raghu Ramakrishnan (2018), Anastasia Ailamaki (2019), Beng Chin Ooi (2020), Alon Halevy (2021), and Dan Suciu (2022).",
                    "Eligibility": "Anyone except the current elected officers of SIGMOD (Chair, Vice Chair, and Treasurer), and members of the SIGMOD Awards Committee. Awards should be for contributions not already honored by a major ACM Award (e.g., the Turing Award, SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award, or SIGMOD Contributions Award). A candidate can be considered for multiple awards as long as each is for a distinct contribution.",
                    "Nomination": "Anyone in the field can nominate one or more persons (self-nominations are excluded). Nominations should include a CV of the nominee, a proposed citation (up to 25 words), a succinct (100- 250 words) description of the innovation/contribution, and a detailed statement to justify the nomination; . Along with the nomination, three additional supporting letters should be submitted. Such letters, however, should not be simple endorsements of the nomination, but convey additional factual information. The Awards Committee will evaluate all nominations and decide on zero or more winners. The Awards Committee itself is free to identify candidates for the award and is not required to pick among submitted nominations. The committee will automatically re-consider previously submitted nominations from the past two years (2021 and 2022). However, nominators are welcome to revise the supporting documents for such candidates if they so wish."

                    "introduction": "The ACM SIGMOD Test of Time Award recognizes the best paper from the SIGMOD proceedings 10 to 12 years prior, based on the criterion of identifying the paper that has had the most impact (research, products, methodology) over the intervening decade. In 2023, papers that were published in the SIGMOD Proceedings in 2011-2013 will be considered. In picking a winner, the Awards Committee evaluates the evidence that the scientific or engineering contributions of the paper have had lasting impact on our research community, on the state-of-the-art in practice, or on society more broadly. The committee values impact in practice and impact in research through significant follow-up research or establishment of a new research area.",

The SIGMOD Systems Award is intended to recognize data management projects that are innovative, and which have widespread deployment and impact. Not every winner has to be equal in both dimensions, but neither pure research projects (innovation without a practical artifact with widespread impact) nor a pure product (a useful artifact without deep innovation) are good candidates.\n\nSome concrete criteria:\n\nIs the project embodied in a piece of software that is widely available?\nIs the software used by a large number of people, and does it have a major practical impact?\nDoes the project embody innovative technical ideas?\nHas the project substantially changed the direction of the field?",
