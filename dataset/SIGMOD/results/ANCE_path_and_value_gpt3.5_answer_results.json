Applications arriving after the deadline will not be considered. The notification date is April 21, 2023.\n\nPlease submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:\n\nStudent's full name and email address.\nName and address of student's school.\nAdvisor's full name and email address.\nA one-page abstract from the student, summarizing a broad view of his/her research with motivation, problem description, approach, and progress; the abstract must be written in English and needs to comply with the two-column ACM proceedings format.\nACM SIGMOD has historically drawn attendees from specific groups including people from Northern European ancestry and from China. It has also been predominantly male. We recognize that we must change our approach and explicitly tailor inclusion efforts to facilitate involvement from underrepresented groups in order to move the needle. If you feel that your presence at SIGMOD would help us address these representational and inclusion disparities, please include a 1 paragraph subsection “Representation” with a brief explanation as part of your submission. This information does not count towards the 1-page limit.\nA 1-2 page CV of the student.\nThe travel award is possible due to generous sponsorships by NSF, SIGMOD EC, and industry partners. We may pass on student winners' contact information to corporate sponsors. Applicants will be asked whether they opt-in to this option.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Special and Co-located Events>>Student Research Competition>>Frequently Asked Questions>>Can students submit in teams?>>Team projects will be accepted from Undergraduates. One person should be designated by the team to make the oral presentation, and only one person will receive the travel stipend per Undergraduate project. Only individual research is accepted from Graduate (Masters or PhD program) students: group research projects will not be considered. However, if an individual is part of a group research project and wants to participate in an SRC, they can only present their part of the research. Only they will receive the travel stipend and monetary award (should they win).\n\nQuestion:How can I ask questions regarding the travel award application process?\nAnswer:", "gt": "You may send your questions regarding the travel award application process to Jana Giceva (jana.giceva@tum.de) and Raul Castro Fernandez (raulcf@uchicago.edu).", "response": "You may send your questions regarding the travel award application process to Jana Giceva (jana.giceva@tum.de) and Raul Castro Fernandez (raulcf@uchicago.edu)."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "What is the PODS community's mission?", "retrieve_results": {"SIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>PODS Call for Research Papers>>PODS Mission>>The PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques and solutions for the data management problems that continually arise in our data-driven society.

Then there will be a moderate Q&A session followed by an open forum for the audience to ask their questions.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Special and Co-located Events>>Student Research Competition>>The Competition>>Second Round: Poster Presentation>>The SRC PC will select a number of students from the abstract to advance to the second round. The second round of the competition will take place at the SIGMOD 2023 conference and will be a poster session. This is your opportunity to present your research to conference attendees and leading experts in data management, including the SRC committee.\n\nJudges will review the posters and speak to participants about their research. The judges will evaluate the research (quality, novelty, and significance) and the presentation of the research (poster, discussion) and select students to advance to the third round of the competition.\n\nQuestion:How many hours will the New Researchers Symposium last?\nAnswer:", "gt": "2 hours.", "response": "The New Researchers Symposium will last for 2 hours, from 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "If I have bought a ticket for the conference but can't make it, can I get a refund?", "retrieve_results": {"SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Visa Information>>Visa Support Letters>>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) does not issue formal invitation letters for visas.

AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process.\n\nPC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors.

For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file.\nNote that the SIGMOD PC members and reviewers are expected to evaluate the originality of a submission and the completeness of the included literature survey. This necessarily involves PC members and reviewers carrying out their own literature search. Therefore, to avoid compromising the double-anonymous review process, we discourage online/public dissemination of pre-prints and working drafts of papers submitted to SIGMOD. In particular, to avoid reviewer bias potentially caused by de-anonymization through preprints (Bharadhwaj et al. 2020), SIGMOD does not allow submissions of papers that appear at pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, unless such servers allow authors to anonymize their papers, by at least temporarily masking their identity until the notification of accept/reject decisions.\n\nYou must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper.

Therefore, to avoid compromising the double-anonymous review process, we discourage online/public dissemination of pre-prints and working drafts of papers submitted to SIGMOD. In particular, to avoid reviewer bias potentially caused by de-anonymization through preprints (Bharadhwaj et al. 2020), SIGMOD does not allow submissions of papers that appear at pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, unless such servers allow authors to anonymize their papers, by at least temporarily masking their identity until the notification of accept/reject decisions.\n\nYou must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper.

These symposia are both informative and entertaining; they are geared towards graduate students and junior researchers, but they often attract a broader audience. This year's SIGMOD New Researcher Symposium is on \"Advice from Early PhD to Early Career: Academia and Industry\". We have put together an exciting panel with diverse viewpoints and perspectives on how to effectively engage in such research.  The panel will begin by each panelist presenting their own experiences as well as advice from early PhD to early Career in academia and/or industry.

After each presentation, there will be a short question and answer session. Evaluations are based on the presenter’s knowledge of his/her research area, the contribution of the research, and the quality of the oral and visual presentation. At most three winners will be chosen in each category, undergraduate and graduate, and receive prizes.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Awards Nomination>>Test-of-time Award>>introduction>>The ACM SIGMOD Test of Time Award recognizes the best paper from the SIGMOD proceedings 10 to 12 years prior, based on the criterion of identifying the paper that has had the most impact (research, products, methodology) over the intervening decade. In 2023, papers that were published in the SIGMOD Proceedings in 2011-2013 will be considered. In picking a winner, the Awards Committee evaluates the evidence that the scientific or engineering contributions of the paper have had lasting impact on our research community, on the state-of-the-art in practice, or on society more broadly. The committee values impact in practice and impact in research through significant follow-up research or establishment of a new research area.\n\nQuestion:How long will the coffee break last each time?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Half an hour.", "response": "I don't know."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "How many sessions are there in SIGMOD's research session?", "retrieve_results": {"SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_3>>Session>>Session 3: Transactions & Indexing": 0.009488582611083984, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_1>>Session>>Session 1: Time Series and data series": 0.00970757007598877, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_5>>Session>>Session 5: Time series and temporal data": 0.0098496675491333, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_26>>Session>>Session 26: Graphs": 0.009942412376403809, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_3>>Time>>11:00 am – 12:30 pm": 0.009952068328857422}, "from": "SIGMOD2023/SIGMOD Program/Detailed Program/Research Sessions", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
