The key ingredients of our randomized algorithm are Laplacian solvers and node sparsifiers, where the latter can preserve pairwise effective resistance by viewing Schur complement as random walks with average length l. For any error parameter ϵ > 0, at each iteration, the randomized algorithm selects a node that deviates from the local optimum marginal gain at most ϵ. The time complexity of the fast algorithm is O(mkllog nϵ− 2). Extensive experiments on various real networks show that the effectiveness of our randomized algorithm is similar to that of the deterministic algorithm, both of which are better than several baseline algorithms, and that our randomized algorithm is more efficient and scalable to large graphs with more than one million nodes.": 0.20745283365249634, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_4>>abstract>>Accurate bot detection is necessary for the safety and integrity of online platforms. It is also crucial for research on the influence of bots in elections, the spread of misinformation, and financial market manipulation. Platforms deploy infrastructure to flag or remove automated accounts, but their tools and data are not publicly available. Thus, the public must rely on third-party bot detection. These tools employ machine learning and often achieve near-perfect performance for classification on existing datasets, suggesting bot detection is accurate, reliable and fit for use in downstream applications. We provide evidence that this is not the case and show that high performance is attributable to limitations in dataset collection and labeling rather than sophistication of the tools. Specifically, we show that simple decision rules — shallow decision trees trained on a small number of features — achieve near-state-of-the-art performance on most available datasets and that bot detection datasets, even when combined together, do not generalize well to out-of-sample datasets. Our findings reveal that predictions are highly dependent on each dataset’s collection and labeling procedures rather than fundamental differences between bots and humans. These results have important implications for both transparency in sampling and labeling procedures and potential biases in research using existing bot detection tools for pre-processing.": 0.21224594116210938, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_11>>abstract>>Knowledge graph question answering aims to identify answers of the query according to the facts in the knowledge graph. In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries. The inferred high quality queries will be returned to the users to help them search with ease. Moreover, all the high-quality candidate nodes will be re-ranked according to the inferred queries.

Our technique computes a sample of provenance based on the distribution of provenance wrt the query result that is estimated from the distribution of input data while considering the correlation among the data. The preliminary evaluation demonstrates that comparing to the naive approach our method efficiently computes a sample of (large size of) provenance with low errors.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms>>SESSION: Social Network Analysis and Graph Algorithms_14>>abstract>>In this paper, we first give an interpretation for the opinion of each node in equilibrium and the disagreement of the model from the perspective of resistor networks. We then develop a fast randomized greedy algorithm to solve the problem. To this end, we express the average opinion in terms of the pseudoinverse and Schur complement of Laplacian matrix for . The key ingredients of our randomized algorithm are Laplacian solvers and node sparsifiers, where the latter can preserve pairwise effective resistance by viewing Schur complement as random walks with average length l. For any error parameter ϵ > 0, at each iteration, the randomized algorithm selects a node that deviates from the local optimum marginal gain at most ϵ. The time complexity of the fast algorithm is O(mkllog nϵ− 2). Extensive experiments on various real networks show that the effectiveness of our randomized algorithm is similar to that of the deterministic algorithm, both of which are better than several baseline algorithms, and that our randomized algorithm is more efficient and scalable to large graphs with more than one million nodes.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web>>SESSION: Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics on the Web_4>>abstract>>Accurate bot detection is necessary for the safety and integrity of online platforms. It is also crucial for research on the influence of bots in elections, the spread of misinformation, and financial market manipulation. Platforms deploy infrastructure to flag or remove automated accounts, but their tools and data are not publicly available. Thus, the public must rely on third-party bot detection. These tools employ machine learning and often achieve near-perfect performance for classification on existing datasets, suggesting bot detection is accurate, reliable and fit for use in downstream applications. We provide evidence that this is not the case and show that high performance is attributable to limitations in dataset collection and labeling rather than sophistication of the tools. Specifically, we show that simple decision rules — shallow decision trees trained on a small number of features — achieve near-state-of-the-art performance on most available datasets and that bot detection datasets, even when combined together, do not generalize well to out-of-sample datasets. Our findings reveal that predictions are highly dependent on each dataset’s collection and labeling procedures rather than fundamental differences between bots and humans. These results have important implications for both transparency in sampling and labeling procedures and potential biases in research using existing bot detection tools for pre-processing.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge>>SESSION: Semantics and Knowledge_11>>abstract>>Knowledge graph question answering aims to identify answers of the query according to the facts in the knowledge graph. In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries. The inferred high quality queries will be returned to the users to help them search with ease. Moreover, all the high-quality candidate nodes will be re-ranked according to the inferred queries. The experiment results show that our proposed method can recommend high-quality query graphs to users and improve the question answering accuracy.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Search>>SESSION: Search_16>>abstract>>In this work, we innovatively explore generating clarifying questions in a zero-shot setting to overcome the cold start problem and we propose a constrained clarifying question generation system which uses both question templates and query facets to guide the effective and precise question generation. The experiment results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines by a large margin. Human annotations to our model outputs also indicate our method generates 25.2% more natural questions, 18.1% more useful questions, 6.1% less unnatural and 4% less useless questions.\n\nQuestion:Can I dispute the reproducibility results?\nAnswer:", "gt": "You will not have to!

These voice assistants often have screens to provide visual content (e.g., images, videos) to their users. There is an increasing trend of users shopping or searching for products using these devices, yet, these voice assistants do not support commands or queries that contain visual references to the content shown on screen (e.g., “blue one”, “red dress”). We introduce a novel multi-modal visual shopping experience where the voice assistant is aware of the visual content shown on the screen and assists the user in item selection using natural language multi-modal interactions. We detail a practical, lightweight end-to-end system architecture spanning from model fine-tuning, deployment, to skill invocation on an Amazon Echo family device with a screen. We also define a niche “Visual Item Selection” task and evaluate whether we can effectively leverage publicly available multi-modal models, and embeddings produced from these models for the task. We show that open source contrastive embeddings like CLIP [30] and ALBEF [24] have zero-shot accuracy above for the “Visual Item Selection” task on an internally collected visual shopping dataset.
