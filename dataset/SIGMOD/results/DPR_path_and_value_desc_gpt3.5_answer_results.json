Each submission must include all author names and affiliations. Changes to the author list after paper acceptance are not permitted. In case an exceptional situation arises necessitating a change in the author list, the situation needs to be explained via email to the industrial track chairs, who will decide whether to approve the change. Authors are encouraged to contact the industrial track chairs if they need clarification regarding the suitability of their work to this track.\n\nWe value diversity and inclusion in our community and professions. As such we require that industrial track papers also follow the guidelines provided for regular research papers. Please refer to the call for papers for research papers for guidelines and examples.\n\nQuestion:What is the paper submission deadline in SIGMOD's industrial track?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Tuesday, November 29, 2022.", "response": "The paper submission deadline in SIGMOD's industrial track is Tuesday, November 29, 2022."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "What is the notification date in SIGMOD's industrial track?", "retrieve_results": {"SIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Industrial Track Papers>>Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)>>Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)_1>>Date>>Tuesday, November 29, 2022": 0.16963332891464233, "SIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Industrial Track Papers>>Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)>>Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)_5>>Date>>Thursday, March 30, 2023": 0.17108041048049927, "SIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Industrial Track Papers>>Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)>>Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)_2>>Date>>Wednesday, January 25, 2023": 0.17544764280319214, "SIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Workshop Proposals>>Important Dates(All deadlines are at 5PM Pacific Daylight Time)>>Important Dates(All deadlines are at 5PM Pacific Daylight Time)_2>>Event>>Workshop proposal notification": 0.1758142113685608, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Program Overview>>THURSDAY (JUNE 22, 2023)>>THURSDAY (JUNE 22, 2023)_7>>time>>14:00-15:30": 0.17749321460723877}, "from": "SIGMOD2023/Calls For Submissions/SIGMOD Call for Industrial Track Papers/Important Dates(All deadlines below are 5 PM Pacific Time)/1/Date", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

We also welcome novel applications of data management systems and experience in applying recent research advances to problems relevant to the database industry.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Research Papers>>LENGTH, FILE TYPE, AND FORMATTING>>The ACM template changed in 2017. Make sure you are using the latest version.\n\nLength for submitted papers: All submitted research papers must be formatted according to the instructions below. The main content of the paper must be no more than 12 pages in length for the Regular Trackpapers and 8 pages for Special Track papers, although we allow an unlimited number of pages for the bibliography. No appendix will be allowed.\n\nLength for revised and camera ready papers: For all tracks in the SIGMOD Research papers, authors are allowed one extra page to help address reviewer comments in the revised version only. Therefore, the length of camera ready papers can be up to: 13 pages (+ unlimited references) for the Regular Track papers and 9 pages (plus unlimited references) for the Special Track papers.\n\nFile type: Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for 8.5\" x 11\" paper and no more than 10 MB in file size. (Larger files will be rejected by the submission site.) Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default configurations.\n\nFormatting: Research papers must follow the 2-column ACM Proceedings Format, using either the sample-sigconf.tex or Interim layout.docx template provided at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template for LaTeX (version 2e) or Word, respectively. If you plan to use ACM's official Overleaf template, please use the 2-column template available at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty. The margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged.
