In the late 1990’s, Gordon Bell and his colleagues at Microsoft Research built MyLifeBits, which was the first serious attempt to build such a database. Since then, technology has improved on several dimensions, making the vision much more realistic. Disks have become much cheaper and therefore storing all of the information is affordable. Mobile technology has significantly enhanced our ability to capture the experiences in our lives, and in practice we’re already leaving digital breadcrumbs about our activities. With the advent of smart glasses, we will be able to easily capture everything we see and experience with little friction. Finally, AI has advanced to the point where it’s possible to create higher-level summaries from individual pieces of raw data (e.g., photos, our movements on maps, shopping records).

In the late 1990’s, Gordon Bell and his colleagues at Microsoft Research built MyLifeBits, which was the first serious attempt to build such a database. Since then, technology has improved on several dimensions, making the vision much more realistic. Disks have become much cheaper and therefore storing all of the information is affordable. Mobile technology has significantly enhanced our ability to capture the experiences in our lives, and in practice we’re already leaving digital breadcrumbs about our activities. With the advent of smart glasses, we will be able to easily capture everything we see and experience with little friction. Finally, AI has advanced to the point where it’s possible to create higher-level summaries from individual pieces of raw data (e.g., photos, our movements on maps, shopping records). This panel will discuss the issues that separate the vision from current reality and focus our attention on the challenges that need to be overcome.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Panel Discussions>>Panel Discussions_1>>moderator>>Raghu Ramakrishnan, Microsoft\n\nSIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Panel Discussions>>Panel Discussions_1>>panelists>>panelists_3>>Sailesh Krishnamurthy, Google\n\nQuestion:Who will moderate the discussion on 'Personal Data for Personal Use: Vision or Reality?'\nAnswer:", "gt": "Alon Halevy and Wang-Chiew Tan, Meta", "response": "<pad> Raghu Ramakrishnan, Microsoft"}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "Who are the sponsors of the 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS?", "retrieve_results": {"SIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Homepage>>name>>2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS": 0.10684895515441895, "SIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Homepage>>SIGMOD&PODS 2023: Sponsors>>Platinum Sponsors>>Platinum Sponsors_6>>Google": 0.11240792274475098, "SIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Homepage>>SIGMOD&PODS 2023: Sponsors>>Gold Sponsors>>Gold Sponsors_6>>ByteDance": 0.11484301090240479, "SIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Homepage>>SIGMOD&PODS 2023: Sponsors>>Platinum Sponsors>>Platinum Sponsors_5>>Apple": 0.11612021923065186, "SIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Homepage>>SIGMOD&PODS 2023: Sponsors>>Gold Sponsors>>Gold Sponsors_4>>ORACLE": 0.11896747350692749}, "from": "SIGMOD2023/Welcome/Homepage/SIGMOD&PODS 2023: Sponsors", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
