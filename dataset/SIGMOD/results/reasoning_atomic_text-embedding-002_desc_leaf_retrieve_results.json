starting a career in data management. These symposia are both informative and entertaining; they are geared towards graduate students and junior researchers, but they often attract a broader audience. This year's SIGMOD New Researcher Symposium is on \"Advice from Early PhD to Early Career: Academia and Industry\". We have put together an exciting panel with diverse viewpoints and perspectives on how to effectively engage in such research.  The panel will begin by each panelist presenting their own experiences as well as advice from early PhD to early Career in academia and/or industry. Then there will be a moderate Q&A session followed by an open forum for the audience to ask their questions.": 0.16083836555480957, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>new researcher
