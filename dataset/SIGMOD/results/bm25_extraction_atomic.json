SIGMOD2023: Welcome: Reproducibility: Packaging Guidelines: information needed: System: System setup is one of the most challenging aspects when repeating experiments. System setup will be easier to conduct if it is automatic rather than manual. Authors should test that the system they distribute can actually be installed in a new environment. The documentation should detail every step in system setup: How to obtain the system? How to configure the environment if need be (e.g., environment variables, paths)? How to compile the system? (existing compilation options should be mentioned) How to use the system? (What are the configuration options and parameters to the system?) How to make sure that the system is installed correctly? The above tasks should be achieved by executing a set o scripts provided by the authors that will download needed components (systems, libraries), initialize the environment, check that software and hardware is compatible, and deploy the system.."}, {"question": "Who is the PODS General Chair?", "answer": "1.
