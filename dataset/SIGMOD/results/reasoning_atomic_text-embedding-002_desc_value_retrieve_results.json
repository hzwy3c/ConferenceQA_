symposium with advice on starting a career in data management. These symposia are both informative and entertaining; they are geared towards graduate students and junior researchers, but they often attract a broader audience. This year's SIGMOD New Researcher Symposium is on \"Advice from Early PhD to Early Career: Academia and Industry\". We have put together an exciting panel with diverse viewpoints and perspectives on how to effectively engage in such research.  The panel will begin by each panelist presenting their own experiences as well as advice from early PhD to early Career in academia and/or industry. Then there will be a moderate Q&A session followed by an open forum for the audience to ask their questions.": 0.1511443853378296, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>new researcher symposium>>location>>Evergreen A": 0.1529807448387146, "SIGMOD2023>>Special and Co-located Events>>New Researchers Symposium>>subject>>Advice from Early PhD to Early Career: Academia and Industry": 0.15364313125610352, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>tutorial sessions>>tutorial sessions_1>>time>>Sunday June 18 9:00 am – 10:30 am": 0.17125189304351807, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_17>>Time>>2:00 pm – 3:30 pm": 0.17228633165359497, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>student research_competition>>student research_competition_2>>time>>Wednesday June 21 4:00 pm – 5:30 pm": 0.17326569557189941, "SIGMOD2023>>Organization>>Conference Officers>>New Researcher Symposium Chairs>>New Researcher Symposium Chairs_2>>country>>USA": 0.174244225025177, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Research Sessions>>Research Sessions_12>>time>>4:00 pm – 5:30 pm": 0.17449700832366943}, "If I have bought a ticket for the conference but can't make it, can I get a refund?": {"SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Note>>All tickets are non-refundable.": 0.171100914478302, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_1>>After May 1, 2023>>$750": 0.18630605936050415, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_1>>Early Bird>>$500": 0.1949326992034912, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_1>>After June 11, 2023>>$800": 0.19980579614639282, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_4>>After May 1, 2023>>$1300": 0.20081496238708496, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_4>>After June 11, 2023>>$1350": 0.20127630233764648, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_4>>Type>>Professional Non-Member": 0.2016836404800415, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Additional Banquet Ticket>>$175": 0.20313936471939087, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_3>>After June 11, 2023>>$1250": 0.2050972580909729, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]>>Full Conference Only [Includes Banquet Ticket]_4>>Early Bird>>$1000": 0.20702511072158813, "SIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Banquet>>requirements>>Conference badge is required for entry into the banquet.
