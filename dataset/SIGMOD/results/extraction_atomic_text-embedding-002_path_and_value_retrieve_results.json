into one searchable database has been around at least since Vannevar Bush’s 1945 paper on the Memex System. In the late 1990’s, Gordon Bell and his colleagues at Microsoft Research built MyLifeBits, which was the first serious attempt to build such a database. Since then, technology has improved on several dimensions, making the vision much more realistic. Disks have become much cheaper and therefore storing all of the information is affordable. Mobile technology has significantly enhanced our ability to capture the experiences in our lives, and in practice we’re already leaving digital breadcrumbs about our activities. With the advent of smart glasses, we will be able to easily capture everything we see and experience with little friction. Finally, AI has advanced to the point where it’s possible to create higher-level summaries from individual pieces of raw data (e.g., photos, our movements on maps, shopping records). This panel will discuss the issues that separate the vision from current reality and focus our attention on the challenges that need to be overcome.": 0.15367025136947632, "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>Panel Discussions>>Panel Discussions_1>>moderator>>Raghu Ramakrishnan, Microsoft": 0.18132764101028442}}
