This information does not count towards the 1-page limit.\nA 1-2 page CV of the student.\nThe travel award is possible due to generous sponsorships by NSF, SIGMOD EC, and industry partners. We may pass on student winners' contact information to corporate sponsors. Applicants will be asked whether they opt-in to this option.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Student Travel Award>>Eligibility>>Applicants need to be a full-time student (undergraduate or graduate). Applicants also need to be a SIGMOD member at the time of receiving this award (to become a member of SIGMOD, you don't need to be a member of the ACM -- students can join SIGMOD for $10.\n\nApplicants are eligible to apply for the SIGMOD travel award even if they have submissions under consideration at other award granting events, such as the Undergraduate Research Program, the Programming Contest, or the New Researcher Symposium. However, an applicant cannot receive more than one travel award in total.\n\nApplicants do not need to have an accepted paper to be eligible. However, students who are primary authors of an accepted paper in the main conference or the workshops are especially encouraged to apply. Junior students without papers accepted for publication at SIGMOD/PODS, but involved in research closely related to the topics of the conference will also be considered. Applications from female and minority students are especially encouraged.\n\nStudents whose advisor cannot provide financial support to attend the conference will be given priority.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Student Travel Award>>Important Dates>>Application submission deadline>>April 11, 2pm PT, 2023\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Student Travel Award>>Important Dates>>Application notification>>April 21, 2023\n\nQuestion:How can I ask questions regarding the travel award application process?\nAnswer:", "gt": "You may send your questions regarding the travel award application process to Jana Giceva (jana.giceva@tum.de) and Raul Castro Fernandez (raulcf@uchicago.edu).", "response": "You may send your questions regarding the travel award application process to Jana Giceva (jana.giceva@tum.de) and Raul Castro Fernandez (raulcf@uchicago.edu).\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Student Travel Award>>Contacts>>You may send your questions regarding the travel award application process to Jana Giceva (jana.giceva@tum.de) and Raul Castro Fernandez (raulcf@uchicago.edu).\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Student Travel Award>>Application Procedure>>To apply for a grant, the student must submit the necessary materials through the website https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMODSTA2023/\nno later than April 11, 2pm PT, 2023.\n\nStudents are encouraged to apply as soon as possible.
