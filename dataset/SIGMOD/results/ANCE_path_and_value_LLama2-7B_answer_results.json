One solution to users’ protection is developing online moderation tools using Machine Learning (ML) techniques for automatic detection or content filtering. On the other hand, the processing of user data requires compliance with privacy policies. This paper proposes a privacy–preserving Federated Learning (FL) framework for online content moderation that incorporates Central Differential Privacy (CDP). We simulate the FL training of a classifier for detecting tweets with harmful content, and we show that the performance of the FL framework can be close to the centralized approach. Moreover, it has a high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number of tweets) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of clients (from fifty to ten) or the tweets per client (from 1K to 100), the classifier can still achieve AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to four other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior and still obtain a promising performance (61% – 80% AUC).": 0.012626826763153076, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_44>>abstract>>Fact-checking is an important tool in fighting online misinformation.

In this demo, we present the Community Notes Observatory, an online system to evaluate the first large-scale effort of crowdsourced fact-checking deployed in practice. We let demo attendees search and analyze tweets that are fact-checked by Community Notes users and compare the crowd’s activity against professional fact-checkers.

One of the effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click behaviors, but this is not elegant in the video feed recommendation where users are passive in receiving the streaming contents and return skip or no-skip behaviors. Here skip and no-skip behaviors can be treated as negative and positive feedback, respectively. With the mixture of positive and negative feedback, it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of behavioral sequence. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer, which may be inelegant because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not consider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest Factorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR) consisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer and prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose each head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations. Then we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific head interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the relation between different types of feedback. Additionally, we propose a dual-interest disentangling layer to decouple positive and negative interests before performing disentanglement on their representations. Finally, we evolve the positive and negative interests by corresponding towers whose outputs are contrastive by BPR loss.

Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks. Due to the deluge of such messages on social media, and their tremendous power to shape our perceptions, there has never been a greater need to automate these analyses, which play a pivotal role in fact-checking, opinion mining, understanding opinion trends, and other such downstream tasks of social consequence. In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it.

This paper proposes a privacy–preserving Federated Learning (FL) framework for online content moderation that incorporates Central Differential Privacy (CDP). We simulate the FL training of a classifier for detecting tweets with harmful content, and we show that the performance of the FL framework can be close to the centralized approach. Moreover, it has a high performance even if a small number of clients (each with a small number of tweets) are available for the FL training. When reducing the number of clients (from fifty to ten) or the tweets per client (from 1K to 100), the classifier can still achieve AUC. Furthermore, we extend the evaluation to four other Twitter datasets that capture different types of user misbehavior and still obtain a promising performance (61% – 80% AUC).\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_44>>abstract>>Fact-checking is an important tool in fighting online misinformation. However, it requires expert human resources, and thus does not scale well on social media because of the flow of new content. Crowdsourcing has been proposed to tackle this challenge, as it can scale with a smaller cost, but it has always been studied in controlled environments. In this demo, we present the Community Notes Observatory, an online system to evaluate the first large-scale effort of crowdsourced fact-checking deployed in practice. We let demo attendees search and analyze tweets that are fact-checked by Community Notes users and compare the crowd’s activity against professional fact-checkers. The attendees will explore evidence of i) differences in how the crowd and experts select content to be checked, ii) how the crowd and the experts retrieve different resources to fact-check, and iii) the edge the crowd shows in fact-checking scalability and efficiency as compared to expert checkers.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Special Track>>CFP: Web4Good (Sustainable Development and Vulnerable Populations)>>Submission deadlines>>All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_15>>abstract>>Accurate user interest modeling is vital for recommendation scenarios. One of the effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click behaviors, but this is not elegant in the video feed recommendation where users are passive in receiving the streaming contents and return skip or no-skip behaviors. Here skip and no-skip behaviors can be treated as negative and positive feedback, respectively. With the mixture of positive and negative feedback, it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of behavioral sequence. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer, which may be inelegant because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not consider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest Factorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR) consisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer and prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose each head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations. Then we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific head interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the relation between different types of feedback. Additionally, we propose a dual-interest disentangling layer to decouple positive and negative interests before performing disentanglement on their representations. Finally, we evolve the positive and negative interests by corresponding towers whose outputs are contrastive by BPR loss. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation study and visualization also sustain its effectiveness.

The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library. Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\nWWW2023>>Important Dates>>February 2023>>February 2023_1>>Event>>Poster and Demo Papers submission\n\nWWW2023>>Important Dates>>November 2022>>November 2022_1>>Event>>Event_3>>Workshop Proposal submission deadline\n\nQuestion:Can I submit my paper for SIGMOD's Industrial Track on November 30, 2022?\nAnswer:", "gt": "No.", "response": "I don't know.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>"}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "Is the submission of SIGMOD's industrial track paper double blind?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization>>SESSION: User Modeling and Personalization_3>>abstract>>The online emergence of multi-modal sharing platforms (e.g., TikTok, Youtube) is powering personalized recommender systems to incorporate various modalities (e.g., visual, textual and acoustic) into the latent user representations. While existing works on multi-modal recommendation exploit multimedia content features in enhancing item embeddings, their model representation capability is limited by heavy label reliance and weak robustness on sparse user behavior data. Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised learning in alleviating label scarcity issue, we explore deriving self-supervision signals with effectively learning of modality-aware user preference and cross-modal dependencies. To this end, we propose a new Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Learning (MMSSL) method which tackles two key challenges. Specifically, to characterize the inter-dependency between the user-item collaborative view and item multi-modal semantic view, we design a modality-aware interactive structure learning paradigm via adversarial perturbations for data augmentation. In addition, to capture the effects that user’s modality-aware interaction pattern would interweave with each other, a cross-modal contrastive learning approach is introduced to jointly preserve the inter-modal semantic commonality and user preference diversity. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method in offering great potential for multimedia recommendation over various state-of-the-art baselines.

Recently, the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users’ attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate weights on texts and images across products.

We present a full implementation of a new approach for loading web pages by splitting up every component and loading the page via a text-based stream.

This means that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are transferred from server to client as files, which by default need to be fully loaded before the web page is displayed. This render-blocking procedure increases loading times significantly, leading to reduced user satisfaction and revenue loss due to lower conversion rates. We present a full implementation of a new approach for loading web pages by splitting up every component and loading the page via a text-based stream. Such a modification aligns with current trends of the HTTP protocol, which has been using streams internally since HTTP/2. It significantly improves loading times, independent of the total page size.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>CFP Web and Society Track>>submission_policy>>Authors should consult the conference’s main Research Track CFP to ensure their submissions are aligned with broader conference expectations, scope, and theme: “Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility”.

However, due to the recent trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, several frameworks have been proposed such as Model Cards, and Data Cards, among others, to help in the appropriate re-usage of those models and datasets. In addition, because of the introduction of the dataspace concept for similar datasets in one place, there is potential that similar Model Cards, Data Cards, Service Cards, and Dataspace Cards can be linked to extract helpful information for better decision-making about which model and data can be used for a specific application. This paper reviews the case for considering a Semantic Web approach for exchanging Model/Data Cards as Linked Data or knowledge graphs in a dataspace, making them machine-readable. We discuss the basic concepts and propose a schema for linking Data Cards and Model Cards within a dataspace. In addition, we introduce the concept of a dataspace card which can be a starting point for extracting knowledge about models and datasets in a dataspace.

However, due to the recent trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, several frameworks have been proposed such as Model Cards, and Data Cards, among others, to help in the appropriate re-usage of those models and datasets. In addition, because of the introduction of the dataspace concept for similar datasets in one place, there is potential that similar Model Cards, Data Cards, Service Cards, and Dataspace Cards can be linked to extract helpful information for better decision-making about which model and data can be used for a specific application. This paper reviews the case for considering a Semantic Web approach for exchanging Model/Data Cards as Linked Data or knowledge graphs in a dataspace, making them machine-readable. We discuss the basic concepts and propose a schema for linking Data Cards and Model Cards within a dataspace. In addition, we introduce the concept of a dataspace card which can be a starting point for extracting knowledge about models and datasets in a dataspace. This helps in building trust and reuse of models and data among companies and individuals participating as publishers or consumers of such assets.\n\nQuestion:Does the Tutorial 7: Demystifying Artificial Intelligence for Data Preparation provide any materials for attendees?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes.
