The approximate K-NN Graph is a directed graph with vertex set V and for each vertex v, it is connected to its approximate k nearest neighbor under one given similarity measure, such as Euclidean distance.\n\nFor this task, you are asked to construct one approximate K-NN Graph for one dataset, which contains a set of high-dimensional vectors and the distance between vectors are measured by Euclidean distance. The challenge here is to design one efficient algorithm to construct the approximate K-NN graph in a limited time.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Reproducibility>>Criteria and Process>>More questions>>Dispute: Can I dispute the reproducibility results?>>You will not have to! If any problems appear during the reproducibility testing phase, the committee will contact you directly, so we can work with you to find the best way to evaluate your work.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Special and Co-located Events>>Programming Contest>>Contest Overview>>Student teams from degree-granting institutions are invited to compete in the annual SIGMOD Programming Contest. This year, the subject of the contest is Approximate K-nearest-neighbor Graph Construction in high dimensional space. Teams' submissions will be judged on their performance on a multi-million-scale dataset.\n\nThe winning team will be awarded a prize of $2,000 (USD), and there will be an additional prize of $1,000 (USD) for the runner-up. Each group in the Finalists has one member eligible to receive a travel grant to attend the SIGMOD 2023 Conference.
