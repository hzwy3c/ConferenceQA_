It was renamed in honor of Dr. Edgar F. Codd in 2004, who invented the relational data model that significantly contributed to the development of the database field as a scientific discipline. The award recognizes unique contributions in the database field.\n\nFor nominations, anyone in the field can propose one or more people, excluding self-nominations. A nomination needs to include a CV of the nominee, a brief citation, a succinct description of the innovation/contribution, and a detailed statement justifying the nomination. Furthermore, three supporting letters, providing additional factual information rather than simple endorsements, should accompany the nomination. The Awards Committee reviews all applications and decides on the winners. The committee is also free to identify award candidates themselves, without being limited to the received nominations. Nominations from the previous two years are automatically reconsidered, but nominators can update the supporting documents if desired. The award is open to anyone except the current elected officers of SIGMOD (Chair, Vice Chair, and Treasurer) and members of the SIGMOD Awards Committee. The award should be for contributions not already recognized by a major ACM Award."}, {"query": "What are the specific requirements and resources for presenting at the SIGMOD2023 conference?", "output": "To present at the SIGMOD2023 conference, the specific requirements and resources include:\n\n1.
