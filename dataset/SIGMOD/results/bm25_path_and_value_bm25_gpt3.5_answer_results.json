These tools can be used to capture the environment, the input files, the expected output files, and the required libraries in a container-like suite. This will help both the authors and the evaluators to seamlessly rerun experiments under specific environments and settings. If using all these tools proves to be difficult for a particular paper, the committee will work with the authors to find the proper solution based on the specifics of the paper and the environment needed.

However, students who are primary authors of an accepted paper in the main conference or the workshops are especially encouraged to apply. Junior students without papers accepted for publication at SIGMOD/PODS, but involved in research closely related to the topics of the conference will also be considered. Applications from female and minority students are especially encouraged.\n\nStudents whose advisor cannot provide financial support to attend the conference will be given priority.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Student Travel Award>>description>>Thanks to the generous support from the National Science Foundation, SIGMOD EC, industry partners, and other sponsors, we will provide travel awards to selected students attending the SIGMOD/PODS conference. The stipend will include financial support for traveling and a conference registration waver.\n\nEach awardee will receive a bursary to partially cover the expense to attend the conference in-person. Awardees are expected to register to the main conference using a free-registration code provided with the award notification email and will have to make their own arrangements for travel and accommodation.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Industrial Track Papers>>Submission Guidelines>>We accept full papers (up to 12 pages + references). The papers should be prepared using the latest standard ACM paper format (see detailed instructions below). Submissions should be uploaded at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMODIndustry2023\n\nSubmissions to the industrial track are not double-blind. Each submission must include all author names and affiliations. Changes to the author list after paper acceptance are not permitted. In case an exceptional situation arises necessitating a change in the author list, the situation needs to be explained via email to the industrial track chairs, who will decide whether to approve the change. Authors are encouraged to contact the industrial track chairs if they need clarification regarding the suitability of their work to this track.\n\nWe value diversity and inclusion in our community and professions. As such we require that industrial track papers also follow the guidelines provided for regular research papers. Please refer to the call for papers for research papers for guidelines and examples.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Fees>>Note>>All tickets are non-refundable.\n\nQuestion:How much would it cost for 5 ACM students to attend the full conference, if they buy tickets on May 2,2023?\nAnswer:", "gt": "$3750", "response": "The cost for 5 ACM students to attend the full conference on May 2, 2023, cannot be determined based on the given information.
