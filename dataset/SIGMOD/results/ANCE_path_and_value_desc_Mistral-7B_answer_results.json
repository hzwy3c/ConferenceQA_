The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively.

It is limited for existing methods merely using textual information for identifying (dis)agreements, especially for cross-domain settings. Social relation information can play an assistant role in the (dis)agreement task besides textual information. We propose a novel method to extract such relation information from (dis)agreement data into an inductive social relation graph, merely using the comment-reply pairs without any additional platform-specific information. The inductive social relation globally considers the historical discussion and the relation between authors. Textual information based on a pre-trained language model and social relation information encoded by pre-trained RGCN are jointly considered for (dis)agreement detection. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for both the in-domain and cross-domain tasks on the benchmark – DEBAGREEMENT. We find social relations can boost the performance of the (dis)agreement detection model, especially for the long-token comment-reply pairs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the social relation graph.

The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems.\n\nWWW2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Research Tracks>>Web Mining and Content Analysis>>Web Mining and Content Analysis_18>>title>>Improving (Dis)agreement Detection with Inductive Social Relation Information From Comment-Reply Interactions\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_19>>abstract>>(Dis)agreement detection aims to identify the authors’ attitudes or positions (agree, disagree, neutral) towards a specific text. It is limited for existing methods merely using textual information for identifying (dis)agreements, especially for cross-domain settings. Social relation information can play an assistant role in the (dis)agreement task besides textual information. We propose a novel method to extract such relation information from (dis)agreement data into an inductive social relation graph, merely using the comment-reply pairs without any additional platform-specific information. The inductive social relation globally considers the historical discussion and the relation between authors. Textual information based on a pre-trained language model and social relation information encoded by pre-trained RGCN are jointly considered for (dis)agreement detection. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for both the in-domain and cross-domain tasks on the benchmark – DEBAGREEMENT. We find social relations can boost the performance of the (dis)agreement detection model, especially for the long-token comment-reply pairs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the social relation graph. We also explore the effect of the knowledge graph embedding methods, the information fusing method, and the time interval in constructing the social relation graph, which shows the effectiveness of our model.\n\nQuestion:Can I dispute the reproducibility results?\nAnswer:", "gt": "You will not have to!
