More specifically, this information should include but not be limited to: double-anonymous reviewing or not; whether the workshop accepts submissions by the chairs and their colleagues; how these submissions will be handled; how any other types of COIs are handled (e.g., in the case when the author names aren’t anonymous while reviewing), as well as a very clear definition of COIs.\nRationale about recruiting the PC of the workshop, for example, diversity considerations (academia/industry, geography, gender, seniority, etc). These criteria should also be taken into account for the choice of the PC Chairs of each workshop.\nPublicity and sponsorship plans.\nShort statement on strategy for carrying out the workshop for both online and on-site participants\nProposal evaluation criteria include the following: relevance to SIGMOD, scientific quality, perceived interest (e.g., previous submission counts), past performance (e.g., publication of the proceedings in the ACM DL), diversity considerations, long-term vision, and overlap with other proposals.

These videos are required to follow the ACM guidelines and will be included in the ACM DL. Additional details about the format and how to submit the pre-recorded videos will be shared at a later date. Please note that the conference will be in-person and requires a registered author to present the paper. The pre-recorded videos are not a substitute for in-person attendance.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Participant Information>>Conference Format>>To have the best experience for all the attendees and facilitate the active discussions and collaborations between presenters and attendees, the 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference and all co-located events (such as Workshops, Panels, Tutorials, Demos, Competitions, etc.) will be in-person. Please submit the following information in a single PDF file with your application:\n\nThere will be NO live streaming or remote participation. The event will be geared towards 100% in-person attendance at the conference venue.\nEach paper should have at least one author registered for in-person attendance and presentation. At least one author must register for the conference before the camera ready submission deadline, otherwise, the paper will not appear in the proceedings. Please include your CMT paper ID, assigned during the review process, when you register for the conference.\nIf a paper cannot have an in-person presenter, the authors need to provide a valid justification, e.g., travel restrictions from their government or visa application not granted for even one author etc.\nFor a paper that cannot have an in-person presenter (due to a valid justification), the authors are expected to communicate with the respective chairs to submit a pre-recorded video or make alternative presentation arrangements.\nWe plan to record some in-person plenary sessions (e.g., Keynote and Award talks) and make them available at a future date AFTER the conference as part of the ACM digital library.\nWe plan to collect pre-recorded videos for the SIGMOD research papers, industrial papers, and demos which will be made available AFTER the conference as part of the ACM digital library.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>SIGMOD Call for Workshop Proposals>>Logistics and Organizational Support>>The organisers of accepted workshops are required to announce the workshop and call for papers, solicit submissions, conduct the reviewing process, and decide on the final workshop program that must be published at least two weeks before the early registration deadline. In addition, each workshop must prepare its own proceedings. The publishing company is at the discretion of the workshop chairs, but all proceedings must be submitted for inclusion in the ACM Digital Library. Publication of calls for papers and participation as well as eventual workshop reports in SIGMOD Record are encouraged.\n\nThe logistics of the workshops will be handled by the SIGMOD 2023 organisation. Specifically, the SIGMOD 2023 local organisation chairs will work with workshop chairs individually to handle registration and the way the workshop will be offered. Depending on the final logistics of the SIGMOD 2023, further details will be communicated.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>PODS Call for Research Papers>>Submission Format>>Submitted papers must be formatted using the standard ACM \"sigconf\" proceedings stylesheet (https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. They can be up to 8 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in an appendix that should be incorporated at submission time (online appendices are not allowed). However, such appendices will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 8 pages (without considering references) or do not cohere with the ACM proceedings style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and one author is expected to present it at the conference. PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process.

Like typical web services, DVE applications may be run on heterogeneous client devices and networks, with users expecting fast response times under 100 ms [12]. However, the resource demands of DVE applications are magnified and highly unpredictable, making it difficult to achieve such interactivity.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Welcome>>Reproducibility>>proposal>>At first, making research shareable seems like an extra overhead for authors. You just had your paper accepted in a major conference; why should you spend more time on it? The answer is to have more impact!\nIf you ask any experienced researcher in academia or in industry, they will tell you that they in fact already follow the reproducibility principles on a daily basis! Not as an afterthought, but as a way of doing good research.\nMaintaining easily reproducible experiments, simply makes working on hard problems much easier by being able to repeat your analysis for different data sets, different hardware, different parameters, etc. Like other leading system designers, you will save significant amounts of time because you will minimize the set up and tuning effort for your experiments. In addition, such practices will help bring new students up to speed after a project has lain dormant for a few months.\nIdeally availability of artifacts reproducibility should be close to zero effort.\n\nSIGMOD2023>>Calls For Submissions>>Important Dates>>SIGMOD Deadlines>>introduction>>There are 3 submission cycles (April, July and October).

However, an applicant cannot receive more than one travel award in total.\n\nApplicants do not need to have an accepted paper to be eligible. However, students who are primary authors of an accepted paper in the main conference or the workshops are especially encouraged to apply.
