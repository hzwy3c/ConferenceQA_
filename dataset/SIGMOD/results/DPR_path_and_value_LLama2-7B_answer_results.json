Recently, techniques that efficiently compute a compact representation of provenance have been introduced. In this work, we introduce a practical solution that computes a sample of provenance for existing results without computing full provenance. Our technique computes a sample of provenance based on the distribution of provenance wrt the query result that is estimated from the distribution of input data while considering the correlation among the data. The preliminary evaluation demonstrates that comparing to the naive approach our method efficiently computes a sample of (large size of) provenance with low errors.": 0.18387800455093384, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week_10>>abstract>>Prior work on explaining missing (unexpected) query results identifies which parts of the query or data are responsible for the erroneous result or repairs the query or data to fix such errors. The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively.

Several researchers focused on seeking new fairness definitions or developing approaches to identify biased predictions. These approaches focus solely on a discrete and limited space; only a few analyze the minimum variations required in the user characteristics to ensure a positive outcome for the individuals (counterfactuals). In that direction, the methodology proposed in this paper aims to unveil unfair model behaviors using counterfactual reasoning in the case of fairness under unawareness. The method also proposes two new metrics that analyse the (estimated) sensitive information of counterfactual samples with the help of an external oracle. Experimental results on three data sets show the effectiveness of our approach for disclosing unfair behaviour of state-of-the-art Machine Learning and debiasing models.

To exploit both types of data, recent works proposed to use unbiased ratings to correct the parameters of the propensity or imputation models trained on the biased dataset.

Recently, techniques that efficiently compute a compact representation of provenance have been introduced. In this work, we introduce a practical solution that computes a sample of provenance for existing results without computing full provenance. Our technique computes a sample of provenance based on the distribution of provenance wrt the query result that is estimated from the distribution of input data while considering the correlation among the data. The preliminary evaluation demonstrates that comparing to the naive approach our method efficiently computes a sample of (large size of) provenance with low errors.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week>>SESSION: Co-Located Event: Provenance Week_10>>abstract>>Prior work on explaining missing (unexpected) query results identifies which parts of the query or data are responsible for the erroneous result or repairs the query or data to fix such errors. The problem of generating repairs is typically expressed as an optimization problem, i.e., a single repair is returned that is optimal wrt. to some criterion such as minimizing the repair’s side effects. However, such an optimization objective may not concretely model a user’s (often hard to formalize) notion of which repair is “correct”. In this paper, we motivate hybrid explanations and repairs, i.e., that fix both the query and the data. Instead of returning one “optimal” repair, we argue for an approach that empowers the user to explore the space of possible repairs effectively. We also present a proof-of-concept implementation and outline open research problems.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos>>SESSION: Alternate track: Posters – Demos_63>>abstract>>The increasing application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models poses potential risks of unfair behaviour and, in the light of recent regulations, has attracted the attention of the research community. Several researchers focused on seeking new fairness definitions or developing approaches to identify biased predictions. These approaches focus solely on a discrete and limited space; only a few analyze the minimum variations required in the user characteristics to ensure a positive outcome for the individuals (counterfactuals). In that direction, the methodology proposed in this paper aims to unveil unfair model behaviors using counterfactual reasoning in the case of fairness under unawareness. The method also proposes two new metrics that analyse the (estimated) sensitive information of counterfactual samples with the help of an external oracle. Experimental results on three data sets show the effectiveness of our approach for disclosing unfair behaviour of state-of-the-art Machine Learning and debiasing models.

In our experiments on two public online news and social media datasets, we show that our approach lets us identify underexplored conceptualizations, such as that health-related content is framed in terms of beliefs for conspiracy media, while mainstream media is instead concerned with science. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for further research on exploratory computational framing analysis using pretrained Transformers.\n\nQuestion:Who will moderate the discussion on 'Personal Data for Personal Use: Vision or Reality?'\nAnswer:", "gt": "Alon Halevy and Wang-Chiew Tan, Meta", "response": "I don't know.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>"}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "Who are the sponsors of the 2023 ACM SIGMOD/PODS?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)_9>>authors>>authors_1>>Kacy Adams": 0.19192808866500854, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: 3rd International Workshop on Scientific Knowledge Representation, Discovery, and Assessment (Sci-K 2023)_2>>abstract>>In response to the call for papers, the workshop has received outstanding submissions from researchers in 15 different countries: United States of America, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, India, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Ethiopia, and Norway.

However, the performance of these solutions is limited by the amount of records available from warm users to use. Thus, building a recommendation system based on few interaction records from a few users still remains a challenging problem for unpopular or early-stage recommendation platforms. This paper focuses on solving the few-shot recommendation problem for news recommendation based on two observations. First, news at different platforms (even in different languages) may share similar topics. Second, the user preference over these topics is transferable across different platforms. Therefore, we propose to solve the few-shot news recommendation problem by transferring the user-news preference from a many-shot source domain to a few-shot target domain. To bridge two domains that are even in different languages and without any overlapping users and news, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-lingual transfer model as the news encoder that aligns semantically similar news in two domains. A user encoder is constructed on top of the aligned news encoding and transfers the user preference from the source to target domain. Experimental results on two real-world news recommendation datasets show the superior performance of our proposed method on addressing few-shot news recommendation, comparing to the baselines.

In this paper, we propose a novel conversational recommendation framework with two unique features: (i) a greedy NDCG attribute selector, to enhance user personalization in the interactive preference elicitation process by prioritizing attributes that most effectively represent the actual preference space of the user; and (ii) a user representation refiner, to effectively fuse together the user preferences collected from the interactive elicitation process to obtain a more personalized understanding of the user. Through extensive experiments on four frequently used datasets, we find the proposed framework not only outperforms all the state-of-the-art conversational recommenders (in terms of both recommendation performance and conversation efficiency), but also provides a more personalized experience for the user under the proposed multi-groundtruth multi-round conversational recommendation setting.": 0.22019827365875244, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry>>SESSION: Alternate Track: Industry_40>>abstract>>Many recommendation systems rely on point-wise models, which score items individually.

In this paper, we propose a novel method which introduces diversity by modeling the impact of low diversity on user’s engagement on individual items, thus being able to account for both diversity and relevance to adjust item scores. The proposed method is designed to be easily pluggable into existing large-scale recommender systems, while introducing minimal changes in the recommendations stack.

Nonetheless, a large fraction of articles (ranging from 10.2% in Dutch to 99.7% in Kazakh) have no short description yet, with detrimental effects for millions of Wikipedia users. Motivated by this problem, we introduce the novel task of automatically generating short descriptions for Wikipedia articles and propose Descartes, a multilingual model for tackling it. Descartes integrates three sources of information to generate an article description in a target language: the text of the article in all its language versions, the already-existing descriptions (if any) of the article in other languages, and semantic type information obtained from a knowledge graph. We evaluate a Descartes model trained for handling 25 languages simultaneously, showing that it beats baselines (including a strong translation-based baseline) and performs on par with monolingual models tailored for specific languages. A human evaluation on three languages further shows that the quality of Descartes’s descriptions is largely indistinguishable from that of human-written descriptions; e.g., 91.3% of our English descriptions (vs. 92.1% of human-written descriptions) pass the bar for inclusion in Wikipedia, suggesting that Descartes is ready for production, with the potential to support human editors in filling a major gap in today’s Wikipedia across languages.": 0.22425967454910278}, "from": "SIGMOD2023/Participant Information/Restaurants/Lincoln Square Dining Options (connected via skyway)/Popular recommendations", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

Motivated by this problem, we introduce the novel task of automatically generating short descriptions for Wikipedia articles and propose Descartes, a multilingual model for tackling it. Descartes integrates three sources of information to generate an article description in a target language: the text of the article in all its language versions, the already-existing descriptions (if any) of the article in other languages, and semantic type information obtained from a knowledge graph. We evaluate a Descartes model trained for handling 25 languages simultaneously, showing that it beats baselines (including a strong translation-based baseline) and performs on par with monolingual models tailored for specific languages. A human evaluation on three languages further shows that the quality of Descartes’s descriptions is largely indistinguishable from that of human-written descriptions; e.g., 91.3% of our English descriptions (vs. 92.1% of human-written descriptions) pass the bar for inclusion in Wikipedia, suggesting that Descartes is ready for production, with the potential to support human editors in filling a major gap in today’s Wikipedia across languages.\n\nQuestion:What are the popular dining recommendations around the Lincoln Square?\nAnswer:", "gt": "There are Ascend Prime Steak & Sushi, Cantina Monarca, Din Tai Fung, Duke’s Seafood, Forum Social House and TopGolf, Lucky Strike, STK Steakhouse and Japonessa Sushi Cocina.", "response": "I'm just an AI and do not have access to real-time information or personalized recommendations.

These opportunities were limited to western audiences earlier on, but globalization has now put almost the entire world online. While there is a growing social understanding and acknowledgment of various gender and ethnic groups in society, we still have a long way to go toward achieving equity in gender and ethnic representations, especially in the workplace. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the diversity and evenness in terms of gender and ethnicity of The WebConference participants over its 30 year history. The choice is motivated by the monumental contribution of this conference to the evolution of the web. In particular, we study the gender and ethnicity of program committee members, authors and other speakers at the conference between 1994-2022. We also generate the co-speaker network over the three decades to study how closely the speakers work with each other.

The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web.\n\nWWW2023>>About>>The Web Conference>>The Web Conference_4>>Starting with the 2018 edition, the conference series previously known as World Wide Web Conference (WWW) has been renamed as The Web Conference or TheWebConf with a new brand and a new communication model. Until 2021, the conferences have been organized by the IW3C2 in collaboration with Local Organizing Committees and Technical Program Committees. The 2022 edition marks another important change in the history of this conference series: it is now integrated into ACM SIGWEB and will be managed by a new steering committee within ACM.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Call For Tutorials Proposals>>description>>We invite proposals for tutorials to be held at The Web Conference 2023 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place in Austin, Texas (USA), on April 30 - May 4, 2023.\nWe invite tutorial proposals on current and emerging topics related to the World Wide Web, broadly construed to include mobile and other Internet and online-enabled modes of interaction and communication. Tutorials will be part of the main conference technical program and are intended to provide a high-quality learning experience to conference attendees. It is expected that tutorials will address an audience with a varied range of interests and backgrounds: beginners, developers, designers, researchers, practitioners, users, lecturers, and representatives of governments and funding agencies who wish to learn new technologies.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Special Track: History of the Web>>SESSION: Special Track: History of the Web_5>>abstract>>The Web has grown considerably since its inception and opened up a multitude of opportunities for people all around the world for work, leisure, and learning. These opportunities were limited to western audiences earlier on, but globalization has now put almost the entire world online. While there is a growing social understanding and acknowledgment of various gender and ethnic groups in society, we still have a long way to go toward achieving equity in gender and ethnic representations, especially in the workplace. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the diversity and evenness in terms of gender and ethnicity of The WebConference participants over its 30 year history. The choice is motivated by the monumental contribution of this conference to the evolution of the web. In particular, we study the gender and ethnicity of program committee members, authors and other speakers at the conference between 1994-2022. We also generate the co-speaker network over the three decades to study how closely the speakers work with each other. Our findings show that we still have a long way to go before achieving fair representation at The WebConference, especially for female participants and individuals from non-White, non-Asian ethnicities.\n\nWWW2023>>calls>>Research Tracks>>TheWebConf 2023 Research Tracks Final Call For Papers (CFP) 'Web Research with Openness, Fairness and Reproducibility'>>Instructions for authors of research tracks submissions>>Scope>>The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially enabled new research and applications. While the Web feeds on and is part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and many others, it remains a distinct scholarly field, with its own research methods, tools, and challenges. As such, submissions that merely use one or another Web artifact — e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network — rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope of the conference and will be rejected early during the reviewing process (“desk-rejected”).\n\nQuestion:What are the special and co-located events organized alongside the conference?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Student Research Competition, Affiliated Workshops, Programming Contest and New Researchers Symposium.", "response": "The conference will include a tutorial session, a call for tutorials proposals, a research track on web research with openness, fairness, and reproducibility, and a special track on the history of the web.</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>"}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "Where and when is the 'HILDA' event taking place on June 18, 2023?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>Important Dates>>Important Dates_7>>Doctoral Consortium: 29 Apr. 2023": 0.20001769065856934, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>Important Dates>>Important Dates_5>>Final decisions: 28 Feb. 2023": 0.20040273666381836, "WWW2023>>Important Dates>>April 2023>>April 2023_3>>Event>>Conference Starts": 0.20089828968048096, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>W4A>>Home>>Important Dates>>Important Dates_3>>Doctoral Consortium: 10 Feb. 2023": 0.2020750641822815, "WWW2023>>calls>>PhD Symposium>>Important dates>>phdSymposiumDate>>May 2, 2023 (to be confirmed)": 0.2089066505432129}, "from": "SIGMOD2023/SIGMOD Program/Program Overview/SUNDAY (June 18, 2023)", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

The conference will take place online, hosted at Austin, USA, on April 30 - May 4, 2023.\nThe Web has proven to be a fertile ground for industrial research, and companies from small to large, from brand new to long established, are making an ongoing impact on the state of the art in science and engineering. The Web Conference 2023 Industry Track highlights such research in applied settings.\nThe Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct from the Research Track in that submissions focus on applied work describing e.g. the implementation of a system, the acquisition of data, or the application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must clearly describe how their work has been deployed or released, and for how long.\nEach submission must include at least one author with a non-academic affiliation.\nAccepted papers will be published in the companion proceedings of The Web Conference, in the ACM Digital Library. Please be aware that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference.

Existing work on Wikipedia text generation has focused on English only where English reference articles are summarized to generate English Wikipedia pages. But, for low-resource languages, the scarcity of reference articles makes monolingual summarization ineffective in solving this problem. Hence, in this work, we propose XWikiGen, which is the task of cross-lingual multi-document summarization of text from multiple reference articles, written in various languages, to generate Wikipedia-style text. Accordingly, we contribute a benchmark dataset, XWikiRef, spanning ∼ 69K Wikipedia articles covering five domains and eight languages. We harness this dataset to train a two-stage system where the input is a set of citations and a section title and the output is a section-specific LR summary. The proposed system is based on a novel idea of neural unsupervised extractive summarization to coarsely identify salient information followed by a neural abstractive model to generate the section-specific text.

However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations.

In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary.

In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention.

In this paper, we focus on improving DST module to generate dialogue states in circumstances with limited annotations and knowledge about slot ontology. To this end, we design a dual prompt learning framework for few-shot DST. The dual framework aims to explore how to utilize the language understanding and generation capabilities of pre-trained language models for DST efficiently. Specifically, we consider the learning of slot generation and value generation as dual tasks, and two kinds of prompts are designed based on this dual structure to incorporate task-related knowledge of these two tasks respectively. In this way, the DST task can be formulated as a language modeling task efficiently under few-shot settings. To evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on two task-oriented dialogue datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot methods, but also can generate unseen slots.

In the vast majority of the existing works, the input queries are considered perfect and can precisely express the user’s query intention. However, in reality, input queries might be ambiguous and elusive which only contain a limited amount of information. Directly answering these ambiguous queries may yield unwanted answers and deteriorate user experience. In this paper, we propose PReFNet which focuses on answering ambiguous queries with pseudo relevance feedback on knowledge graphs. In order to leverage the hidden (pseudo) relevance information existed in the results that are initially returned from a given query, PReFNet treats the top-k returned candidate answers as a set of most relevant answers, and uses variational Bayesian inference to infer user’s query intention. To boost the quality of the inferred queries, a neighborhood embedding based VGAE model is used to prune inferior inferred queries. The inferred high quality queries will be returned to the users to help them search with ease. Moreover, all the high-quality candidate nodes will be re-ranked according to the inferred queries.

He’s been appointed Research Affiliate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) at MIT, his alma mater. For 11 years Bob served as Professor of Innovation at the Cockrell School of Engineering, Professor of Entrepreneurship at the McCombs School of Business, and Murchison Fellow of Free Enterprise at The University of Texas at Austin. Bob retired from UTAustin as Emeritus Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. “My work here, on the Texas/Austin/UTAustin startup ecosystem, is done.” Bob was an Internet pioneer beginning in 1970 at MIT, Harvard, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), Stanford, and 3Com. He invented Ethernet at Parc on May 22, 1973. Today Ethernet is the Internet ‘ s standard plumbing, each year adding billions of ports, if we let Bob count Wireless Ethernet (Wi-Fi). Bob remains a champion of Ethernet and connectivity in general, according to Metcalfe’s Law (V~N^2). The Internet turned 50 in 2019, just in time for COVID-19. The most important new fact about the human condition is that, and it ‘ s mostly good news, we are now suddenly connected. Among many other honors, Bob has won the Bell, Hopper, Japan C&C, Marconi, McCluskey, Shannon, and Stibitz Prizes. He has been inducted into the Internet, Consumer Electronics, and Computer History Museum Halls of Fame. He is Emeritus Life Trustee of MIT. Bob received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Medal of Honor in 1996 and the National Medal of Technology in 2005 for leadership in the invention, standardization, and commercialization of Ethernet. Bob founded Internet startup 3Com Corporation in Silicon Valley on June 4, 1979. 3Com went public on March 21, 1984. Bob &quot retired” from 3Com in 1990. In 1999, 3Com revenue was $5.7B, and its market capitalization peaked momentarily at an inflation-adjusted $52 billion, of which Bob didn’t even get half. 3Com was acquired by HP Enterprise in 2010. During the 1990s, Bob was CEO/Publisher/Pundit at IDG/InfoWorld Magazine. His Internet column, FROM THE ETHER, was read weekly by a million? information technologists among IDG ‘ s 90 countries. In his column he was famously wrong in predicting the Internet would suffer a gigalapse in 1996. Read all about this prediction in Bob ‘ s book, INTERNET COLLAPSES, still available on Amazon.com.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving.

To avoid these new legislations, decentralized finance enterprises may shop for fiscally advantageous jurisdictions. This study explores global tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises. Opportunities are identified by considering various jurisdictions’ tax laws on cryptocurrencies along with their corporate income tax rates, corporate capital gains tax rates, level of financial development and level of cryptocurrency adoption. They are visualized with the manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction (UMAP) technique. The study results show that there exist a substantial number of tax evasion opportunities for decentralized finance enterprises through both traditional offshore jurisdictions and crypto-advantageous jurisdictions. The latter jurisdictions are usually considered high-tax fiscal regimes; but, given that they do not apply tax laws, tax evasion opportunities arise, especially in jurisdictions that have high financial development and high cryptocurrency adoption. Further research should investigate these new opportunities and how they are evolving. Understanding the global landscape surrounding tax evasion opportunities in decentralized finance represents a first step at preventing corporate capital flight of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies>>SESSION: Workshop: 1st Workshop on Federated Learning Technologies_1>>abstract>>AI-based systems, especially those based on machine learning technologies, have become central in modern societies.

Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks. Due to the deluge of such messages on social media, and their tremendous power to shape our perceptions, there has never been a greater need to automate these analyses, which play a pivotal role in fact-checking, opinion mining, understanding opinion trends, and other such downstream tasks of social consequence. In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.": 0.13051843643188477, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_6>>abstract>>Social Media (SM) has become a stage for people to share thoughts, emotions, opinions, and almost every other aspect of their daily lives. This abundance of human interaction makes SM particularly attractive for social sensing. Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums, users post information and encourage others to support their side, using symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless, the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals’ stances. We analyze users’ attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines.": 0.13067281246185303, "WWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_1>>abstract>>The inclusion of autistic people can be augmented by a mobile app that provides information without a human mediator making information perception more liberating for people in the spectrum.

Generally, healthcare consumers use long and detailed questions with several peripheral details to express their healthcare concerns, contributing to natural language understanding challenges. One way to address this challenge is by summarizing the questions. However, most of the existing abstractive summarization systems generate impeccably fluent yet factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary.

Any automated system that intends to capture the social, cultural, or political zeitgeist, must be able to analyze the claims as well as the remarks. Due to the deluge of such messages on social media, and their tremendous power to shape our perceptions, there has never been a greater need to automate these analyses, which play a pivotal role in fact-checking, opinion mining, understanding opinion trends, and other such downstream tasks of social consequence. In this noisy ecosystem, not all claims are worth checking for veracity. Such a check-worthy claim, moreover, must be accurately distilled from subjective remarks surrounding it. Finally, and especially for understanding opinion trends, it is important to understand the stance of the remarks or reactions towards that specific claim. To this end, we introduce a COVID-19 Twitter dataset, and present a three-stage process to (i) determine whether a given Tweet is indeed check-worthy, and if so, (ii) which portion of the Tweet ought to be checked for veracity, and finally, (iii) determine the author’s stance towards the claim in that Tweet, thus introducing the novel task of topic-agnostic stance detection.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)>>SESSION: Workshop: The 11th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP 2023)_6>>abstract>>Social Media (SM) has become a stage for people to share thoughts, emotions, opinions, and almost every other aspect of their daily lives. This abundance of human interaction makes SM particularly attractive for social sensing. Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums, users post information and encourage others to support their side, using symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless, the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals’ stances. We analyze users’ attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium>>SESSION: Alternate Track: PhD Symposium_1>>abstract>>The inclusion of autistic people can be augmented by a mobile app that provides information without a human mediator making information perception more liberating for people in the spectrum. This paper is an overview of a doctoral work dedicated to the development of a web-based mobile tool for supporting the inclusion of people on the autism spectrum. The work includes UX/UI research conducted with psychiatry experts, web information retrieval study and neural question-answering research. Currently, the study results comprise several mobile app layouts, a retriever-reader model design and fine-tuned neural network for extractive question-answering.

The aim of our algorithm is to discover underlying topics in a multilingual dataset using clustering. We present both a numerical evaluation using silhouette and V-measure metrics, and a qualitative evaluation for which we propose a new systematic approach. Our algorithm presents robust overall performance and its results were empirically evaluated by an analyst. The work we present was done in the context of a large multilingual public consultation, for which our new algorithm was deployed and used on a daily basis.\n\nWWW2023>>Proceedings>>Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis>>SESSION: Web Mining and Content Analysis_40>>abstract>>In recent years, seeking health information on the web has become a preferred way for healthcare consumers to support their information needs. Generally, healthcare consumers use long and detailed questions with several peripheral details to express their healthcare concerns, contributing to natural language understanding challenges. One way to address this challenge is by summarizing the questions. However, most of the existing abstractive summarization systems generate impeccably fluent yet factually incorrect summaries. In this paper, we present a semantically-enhanced contrastive learning-based framework for generating abstractive question summaries that are faithful and factually correct. We devised multiple strategies based on question semantics to generate the erroneous (negative) summaries, such that the model has the understanding of plausible and incorrect perturbations of the original summary. Our extensive experimental results on two benchmark consumer health question summarization datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method by achieving state-of-the-art performance and generating factually correct and fluent summaries, as measured by human evaluation.\n\nQuestion:Who will be moderating the panel discussion on 'Personal Data for Personal Use: Vision or Reality?'?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The panel discussion on 'Personal Data for Personal Use: Vision or Reality?' will be moderated by Alon Halevy and Wang-Chiew Tan.", "response": "The panel discussion on 'Personal Data for Personal Use: Vision or Reality?' will be moderated by [Name].</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>"}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "Who are the session chairs for the student research competition at SIGMOD2023?", "retrieve_results": {"WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>ProvenanceWeek2023>>Workshop Program>>Monday, May 1>>Panelists>>Bryon Jacob (data.world), Deborah McGuinness (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Paolo Missier (Newcastle University), Luc Moreau (King's College London)": 0.11448943614959717, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>sections>>sections_2>>content>>content_12>>6:00 pm – 6:45 pm: The Future of Web Science Panel\nModerated by Ágnes Horvát, Northwestern University:\nPanelists:\n- Deborah McGuinness, RPI\n- Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Northeastern University\n- Weihang Wang, USC\n- Noshir Contractor, Northwestern University\n- Dame Wendy Hall, University of Southampton": 0.12674754858016968, "WWW2023>>calls>>Call For Workshops Proposals>>Track chairs(workshop2023@thewebconf.org)>>Track chairs(workshop2023@thewebconf.org)_2>>affiliation>>Ghent University - imec": 0.12960195541381836, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>Web Sci2023>>Program>>Awards>>Test of Time Award Committee>>Test of Time Award Committee_1>>Dr. Ágnes Horvát, Northwestern University (Chair)": 0.13153564929962158, "WWW2023>>Satellite Events>>ProvenanceWeek2023>>Organizers>>IPAW SC Chair>>Paul Groth": 0.1347317099571228}, "from": "SIGMOD2023>>SIGMOD Program>>Detailed Program>>student research_competition>>session_chairs", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
