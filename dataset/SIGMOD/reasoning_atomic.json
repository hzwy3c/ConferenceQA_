The approximate K-NN Graph is a directed graph with vertex set V and for each vertex v, it is connected to its approximate k nearest neighbor under one given similarity measure, such as Euclidean distance. For this task, you are asked to construct one approximate K-NN Graph for one dataset, which contains a set of high-dimensional vectors and the distance between vectors are measured by Euclidean distance. The challenge here is to design one efficient algorithm to construct the approximate K-NN graph in a limited time.",
