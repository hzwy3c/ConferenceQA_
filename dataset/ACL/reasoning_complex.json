            "question": "What is the submission process for main conference?",
            "answer": "Submissions for main conference must follow the ACL 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics. The submissions to ACL and any supplementary materials must not include authors’ names and affiliations, or the acknowledgments section. Self-references that reveal the authors’ identities must be avoided. We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. ACL 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review.",
