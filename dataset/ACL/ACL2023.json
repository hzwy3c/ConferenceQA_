                    "title": "ACL 2023 Acceptance Recommendations",
                    "content": "One of frequent complaints at the past conferences was that solid work was rejected for not being “surprising”/”novel”/”too niche”/etc, based on reviewers’ rather subjective views. This is difficult to combat because in a system in which the reviewer provides a single recommendation score, such subjective preferences are inevitably tangled with judgements on the other aspects of the paper.\nACL’23 is experimenting with an alternative paper scoring system. Instead of the traditional “overall recommendation” score, we explicitly ask reviewers about whether the submission presents sound research, and how exciting they personally find it. The former criterion can be estimated more objectively, as long as the reviewers have sufficient expertise. The latter is inevitably more subjective, and may reflect the reviewers’ own research agenda, perception of novelty, potential utility to themselves or their sub-community, or other such factors that are hard to disentangle – but reviewers do wish to communicate. You can see the full form and its scoring rubrics here.\nThe pros of this separation of “soundness” and “excitement” are as follows:\nthe reviewers should be able to provide more accurate estimates of soundness by disentangling their own research interests and preferences;\nthe reviewer job is easier (especially the new reviewers, who may not have a very clear idea of what is expected of an *ACL paper, could find it hard to make that call);\nthe authors receive more actionable information from the review: e.g. instead of overall score “3” you get “2” in soundness and “4” in excitement, you know that you need to revise and resubmit, and if it’s the other way round - then you just were not lucky to find a reviewer who shares your interests;\nthe authors can focus their response on soundness (where reasonable argumentation is possible) rather than excitement (where it may not be very productive to try to convince the reviewers that their research tastes are wrong);\nthe chairs have more information for assembling the program and planning the conference sessions;\nthrough correlating these scores with paper types,we can learn the implicit and explicit norms and attitudes in the field to improve the peer review process.\nOne complaint we’ve seen on social media is that the old system of an overall score offered a better clue as to whether a paper is going to get in and are disappointed because they don’t see such a straightforward mapping here. However, even the regular “overall recommendation” could only be trusted for the relatively few papers with all top scores or all low scores. In the middle, much is at the discretion of the chairs, who rely on the full review text, consider reviewer confidence and expertise, etc. It’s the same in our case, except that the chairs get a bit more information to go on. Our hope is that this information will help chairs come to better conclusions.\nLet’s dig into this a bit more:\nneither score is functionally equivalent to the traditional “overall recommendation” score (unfortunately, softconf shows statistics for only one of them in the review reports, but that does not mean it’s the same as the old score);\nthe “soundness” score is more important: non-scientifically-sound papers should not be published anywhere. This follows from our CFP and common sense. (Some reviewers saw early review reports that highlighted excitement scores but not soundness thought that meant excitement is more central to accept/reject decisions; this is certainly not the case. This was just a symptom of Softconf catching up to the new review criteria, and it is now fixed.)\nthe “excitement” score helps decision makers understand reviews better. In conferences using a single recommendation score, a paper with three middling scores is difficult to make a decision about. In ACL’23, if such a paper scores high on soundness but low on excitement, it’s clear that it should be accepted somewhere. If the soundness scores are all low but some reviewers are excited, this probably means the paper is a great idea but needs more development. That said, as in any conference, the chairs have discretion based on their high-level knowledge of the field and editorial priorities. They may also downweigh or discard reviews that have serious issues, low reviewer confidence, etc.\nThe primary purpose of the author response period is always to clarify any misunderstandings and to improve the accuracy of the reviews. It is the same in our case. We recommend to focus on soundness, because it is realistically the score that is more likely to be improved through clarifications, than “this is not surprising” kind of comments. That said, the authors are of course welcome to address any reviewer points that they wish. An additional quality assurance step that is new at ACL’23 is that the authors can flag serious issues in reviews by their type for the chairs.\nWe recognize that this is new and different. It’s an experiment. Thus, to help everyone better understand what’s going on, we are sharing the distribution of the “excitement” and “soundness” scores below. As you can see, most submissions are in the middle of the distribution, just like with the regular single-score process.\nOverall distribution for 'soundness' and 'excitement' scores at ACL 2023 (pre-rebuttal)",

                            "A": "This absolutely is possible (in particular, soundness may be evinced through concepts like clarity and comprehensiveness). But this is also the fundamental problem with the usual “overall recommendation”, which everybody also interprets in very different ways. We hope that our questions are still an improvement in concreteness over the single-score questions, and can be further improved on."

                            "A": "If the whole scale is skewed, all papers are affected the same, it’s just that the average score will be lower than usual. But this gives us more granularity at the positive end of the spectrum, where we hope that the bulk of the papers would be."

                            "Q": "Since it can be challenging to fully assess the correctness and soundness of complex techniques, the “soundness” scores may be biased towards technically lighter papers.",
                            "A": "This is a possibility, and we will need to do some analysis of low-scoring papers to see if that is the case. But one more relevant aspect here is clarity: if the paper is technically more complex, but manages to explain their method more clearly than other complex papers, “soundness” metric will reward that - and that is arguably a good thing, since it likely correlates with potential impact."

If you notice any serious issues with the paper (format violations, missing compulsory sections, deanonymization through self-citations, acknowledgements or non-anonymous repositories), or you feel that the paper is too far out of your area of expertise, reach out to your senior area chair so that they can adjust the assignments or consider desk rejection. If you only look at the paper close to the deadline, it will be too late (and you’ll have to review it anyway, so checking early can save you work!).  The submission has to contain the actual paper, which may be accompanied by appendices, code and/or data. As a general rule, the paper should be readable as a standalone document, and any details important for understanding the key aspects of the work should be in the paper rather than in appendices, accompanying source code, etc. Non-key aspects (e.g. implementation details, parameters, examples or experiments that provide extra support for the main claims) can be provided in the supplementary materials, and you can consider them if you have questions. Each paper is also accompanied by the responsible NLP checklist (visible in the submission page). It can be viewed as a kind of FAQ for the paper (Are hyperparameters reported? Was the study IRB approved? Were the participants fairly compensated? etc.) If after reading the paper you have a question that falls in the scope of the checklist, please see if it is already answered to your satisfaction before raising it in your review.

                            "content": "The full form can be viewed here.  Your review will be seen by three different audiences: (a) the authors, (b) the other reviewers and the area chair, and (c) the senior area chairs and the program chairs (this is discussed in more detail below, “writing a strong review”). Not all parts of the form are addressed to all of them. What is this paper about?  The summary of a paper should be just that: a neutral, dispassionate summary of the research question and findings/contributions. We would help the program chairs the most by not tainting these summaries with, e.g., suggestions that the topic is exciting or a waste of time.  Make sure you acknowledge all the contributions that you believe the paper is making: experimental evidence, replication, framing of a new question, artifacts that can be used in future work (models, resources, code), literature review, establishing new cross-disciplinary connections, conceptual developments, theoretical arguments. A paper may make several contributions, and not all of them need to be equally strong. You should state in your own words what you see as contributions of the paper, rather than copy/paste it from the abstract. This helps the authors and the chairs to see that you understood the gist of the paper, and hence the rest of your review should be taken seriously. Reasons to accept  Even if you fundamentally disagree with something in the paper, it is important for the program chairs (and the mental health of the authors) that you accurately state all the best aspects of it. It also helps them to see that you actually understand the work, and hence any criticisms should be taken seriously.  The contributions of the paper are the obvious candidates for the “reasons to accept”. They may come in many different forms and should be recognized, even if they are not the type of contribution that you aim for in your own work. ACL CFP explicitly welcomes the following kinds of contributions: an engineering solution, a literature review, a useful artifact (a model, software, a resource), reproduction of prior results, analysis (of models or data), theory, argumentation/position.  In assessing a contribution, performance improvements or complex math are by themselves neither necessary nor sufficient. It should be clear in what way the study advances the field: what did we learn from it that we did not know before? What can we do that we could not do before? Are the research claims clearly articulated and sufficiently backed up by the appropriate evidence, literature or theory/arguments?  If one of the strengths is the performance of the proposed system, do check that the baseline is sufficiently strong and well-tuned, and that the result is robust (e.g., not just the best of an unknown number of runs with unknown standard deviation between runs). Ideally, the computation budget should be reported. If you cannot find something in the paper, see if the responsible NLP checklist contains any answers or pointers to the paper or supplementary materials.  Apart from the contributions of the paper, its strengths may be in e.g. being clear and well-written, in formulating a timely/important question, in proposing a better framing of a problem, showing previously ignored connections between ideas/fields, a conceptual development, etc. Reasons to reject  Many things could go wrong in a study. Although reviewers often disagree about acceptance recommendations for papers above a certain quality threshold, the NeurIPS experiment showed that low-quality papers are identified quite reliably. There may be claims that are not actually supported by the evidence or by the arguments, but that are presented as conclusions rather than as hypotheses/discussion. The framing may be misleading. There may be obvious methodological flaws (e.g., only the best run results are reported), errors in the proofs, in the implementation, or in the analysis. There may be insufficient detail to understand what was done or how to reproduce the method and the results. There may be a lack of clarity about what the research question is (even if it is “Does system A work better than system B”?), what was done, why, and what was the conclusion. The paper should also make it clear in what way the findings and/or the released artifacts advance the field.  At the same time, there are many complaints about reviews at previous conferences that cite as weaknesses things that are not in fact weaknesses, but rather belong in the “suggestions” box. Once you have the first draft of your review, you will need to revisit it to check for these frequent issues.  Every work has limitations, and ACL 2023 submissions include a mandatory section for discussing that. Please take care to not penalize the authors for seriously thinking through the limitations of their work, in ethical or any other aspect. First, this information is crucial for future work. Second, if we as a community reward focusing only on positive aspects of research, this contributes to the over-hyping problem which damages the credibility of the whole field. Questions for the Author(s)  Do you have major questions for the authors - especially if their answers would be relevant for your recommendation? Please note that the authors will have limited space to answer, and this section should be reserved for the “big” questions - not things like typos or non-critical missing references.  Please use the letter numbering scheme for your questions, e.g.  Question A: Question B: Question C:  Combined with your reviewer number, this will make it easy to refer to your questions in rebuttal and reviewer discussion (e.g. question 2A = question A of reviewer 2). Missing References  Please list any references that should be included in the bibliography or need to be discussed in more depth. If you mentioned missing previous work or lack of baselines, give the full citation. In particular, if you say that the submission lacks novelty, please be sure to include the specific work that you believe to be similar. Typos, Grammar, Style, and Presentation Improvements  While the other fields are written for the chairs, this field is exclusively a message to the authors. This is the place for presentation suggestions, clarifications, pointing out (a reasonable amount of) typos or language errors: the small things that you do not consider “weaknesses” and should not distract the chairs from your overall assessment. Of course, if you find the paper completely illegible or unclear, such issues can escalate to the “weakness” list for the chairs.  Things could be unclear because it is generally not easy to communicate clearly and effectively with a wide audience—especially when you have been working on a project for a long time and it all seems obvious to yourself, but not to others. Reviewers are the beta-readers, who can help the authors to significantly improve their papers. If you see something that they could do to increase the potential impact of their work, it is professional courtesy to let them know. Some examples include figures that are hard to read or interpret, the points that require extra background reading, ambiguity, and non-obvious connections between sections. If you have comments or questions that you would like the authors to respond to (beyond “thanks, we’ll fix this”), please move them to the “questions for the authors” and include them in the letter-numbered questions.  Be careful in suggesting citations of your own papers. When you have truly relevant related work, this is appropriate, but it is also potentially de-anonymizing (especially when the paper in question is not very well-known). One workaround is to suggest several citations, including yours. Reproducibility, Ethics Review, Anonymity Requirement and Overall Recommendation  The most important part of the review is your thorough comments. However, what many people focus on are numbers, particularly the “overall recommendation”. Thus, it would be remiss for our advice to overlook this part of the process.  ACL 2023 is trying something new this year. We are splitting this decision into two parts: how sound the paper is and how exciting you find the paper.  Soundness goes to how well the paper clearly states its claims and backs up them with evidence and argumentation. We want all papers to clear a minimum bar for presenting solid, thorough, technically sound research. We suspect that this will have lower variance than the other key metric, excitement. Please work with your fellow reviewers to come to a consensus: what are the claims of the paper and do you believe them?  Excitement captures the more subjective evaluations of the novelty/significance of the contributions, and their potential interesting-ness to the community. Because not everyone will calibrate their scores the same way (this will depend on the batch of papers you get, your research area, and the direction you think the field should go), make sure that your scores are justified in the text of the review.  The AC should be able to understand your justification of both scores to create a consensus score from all of the reviews. Please try to disentangle these two aspects in your review: e.g. even if you find a paper boring, it could still be sound and thorough.  Reproducibility  As you assess the reproducibility of the paper, think about not just whether the raw information to reproduce the paper are included. Also think about how easy it would be to reproduce the paper: imagine you had to tell someone who had a strong CS or Linguistics background but was not immersed in the field how to reproduce the paper in an e-mail. Could you just hand them the submission? If not, how long would the e-mail be to fill in the gaps?  Confidence  If your confidence is low, please use the confidential comments section at the end of the form to let your meta-reviewer know which aspects of your review might not be reliable.  The review form also allows you to flag the paper for potential breaches of ACL’s anonymity period, or indicate that you know the authors’ identity from some source.  Best Paper Award  Reviewers are often a little too conservative in their nominations. After all, you just written down all of the flaws in the paper. And you may think about all of the best papers you’ve seen… but only after the review process and incorporating all of the great suggestions reviewers like you can make. Rather than thinking about the question as “is this a best paper” as is, consider the question more as “how could you argue that this will be best paper”. It is okay if this paper is unique in topic or technique, that could be what makes it a best paper! "

The only change is A4, a question about the use of AI writing assistants.  This checklist serves a triple purpose. The reviewers can treat it as a kind of FAQ: if after reading the paper they have questions about reproducibility, approval, compensation to the study participants, licenses etc. - they can see if these questions have already been answered to their satisfaction, before writing a negative review. To the authors, it gives the space to preemptively answer such questions and to make sure that they weren’t forgotten during writing. Finally, since the ACL2023 checklist answers will be part of publication of accepted papers, they generally help to improve the transparency of NLP research.  For your convenience, here is the full list of questions that all authors answered as part of their submission.  A. For every submission:  A1. Did you describe the limitations of your work? A2. Did you discuss any potential risks of your work? A3. Do the abstract and introduction summarize the paper’s main claims? A4. Did you use AI writing assistants when working on this paper?  B. Did you use or create scientific artifacts?  B1. Did you cite the creators of artifacts you used? B2. Did you discuss the license or terms for use and / or distribution of any artifacts? B3. Did you discuss if your use of existing artifact(s) was consistent with their intended use, provided that it was specified? For the artifacts you create, do you specify intended use and whether that is compatible with the original access conditions (in particular, derivatives of data accessed for research purposes should not be used outside of research contexts)? B4. Did you discuss the steps taken to check whether the data that was collected / used contains any information that names or uniquely identifies individual people or offensive content, and the steps taken to protect / anonymize it? B5. Did you provide documentation of the artifacts, e.g., coverage of domains, languages, and linguistic phenomena, demographic groups represented, etc.? B6. Did you report relevant statistics like the number of examples, details of train / test / dev splits, etc. for the data that you used / created?  C. Did you run computational experiments?  C1. Did you report the number of parameters in the models used, the total computational budget (e.g., GPU hours), and computing infrastructure used? C2. Did you discuss the experimental setup, including hyperparameter search and best-found hyperparameter values? C3. Did you report descriptive statistics about your results (e.g., error bars around results, summary statistics from sets of experiments), and is it transparent whether you are reporting the max, mean, etc. or just a single run? C4. If you used existing packages (e.g., for preprocessing, for normalization, or for evaluation), did you report the implementation, model, and parameter settings used (e.g., NLTK, Spacy, ROUGE, etc.)?  D. Did you use human annotators (e.g., crowdworkers) or research with human participants?  D1. Did you report the full text of instructions given to participants, including e.g., screenshots, disclaimers of any risks to participants or annotators, etc.? D2. Did you report information about how you recruited (e.g., crowdsourcing platform, students) and paid participants, and discuss if such payment is adequate given the participants’ demographic (e.g., country of residence)? D3. Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you’re using/curating? D4. Was the data collection protocol approved (or determined exempt) by an ethics review board? D5. Did you report the basic demographic and geographic characteristics of the annotator population that is the source of the data?  "

If you see something that you think could be problematic, you can flag the paper to be reviewed by a dedicated ethics review team. Generally, reviewers should look for issues with use of data sets and how they were collected, potential abuse, and disadvantages for minority groups. Please consider the relevant Ethics review questions and the Ethics FAQ, as needed. Many commonly asked questions relevant to the ethics review are a part of the Responsible NLP checklist, and so the authors have already answered them for you as part of their submission.  How do you tell if the authors’ answers are satisfactory? There is no single number for what counts as “fair pay”, nor a simple rule that would account for “legal grounds for data collection/processing”. The laws and practices at the authors’ home country and institution probably differ from yours, and it would be unfair to expect that the authors would follow exactly your own practice. So fundamentally the authors make their case for what they did, and try to convince you that this was appropriate – similarly to all other aspects of paper review. That being said, the broad principles of the ACM Code of Ethics need to be upheld, even for the authors from the countries that did not ratify the human rights convention. If you believe there may be a serious ethical issue, but you lack the expertise to evaluate it, you may flag the paper for a separate review process by the ACL ethics committee. They will make a recommendation as to whether the paper should be accepted, revised, or rejected on ethical grounds. "

The fact is, authors and reviewers _are _actually the same people: the conference crowd lining up for coffee, happily chatting with each other about the grand problems of AI even if they do not always agree. Why can’t we do peer review in the same spirit of fun intellectual interaction with colleagues?  Just like the conference coffee break chats, reviewing is in fact mutually beneficial: in exchange for feedback, the reviewers get to have the first look at cutting-edge research. Just like the coffee breaks, where you do not necessarily meet only the people working in your subsubfield, peer review may expose you to new techniques. Since there is careful written communication in the authors’ response, you may even find that you were wrong about something, which is a much faster way to learn than making the same mistake in your own research.  Not to mention, someone out there is reviewing your papers too. The more rude reviews there are, the more of a norm they become, and the higher the chances you will get one yourself in the future. "

If you pointed out a weakness and then saw it also pointed out by someone else, you may feel it is a more severe problem than you originally thought. You may “discard” your own opinion if you see the opinion of someone you believe to be more senior/experienced/famous. If your original opinion was very positive, in the face of a strongly negative review you may be tempted to “converge to the mean” (or the other way round). Ask yourself if this is really warranted, and whether this may be reflecting some core dispute between approaches/methodologies etc. Strong disagreements may be an indication that the paper is doing something unusual and interesting.

The following types of issues are known from past conferences: A. The review is not specific enough, e.g. missing references are not specified B. The review exhibits one of the heuristics discussed in the ACL23 review policy blog post, such as \"not novel\", \"not surprising\", \"too simple\", \"not SOTA\".

Please flag only the cases where you believe that the reviewer has not done due diligence. C. The scores do not match the review text. Note that in ACL23, the \"soundness\" score is meant to reflect the technical merit of the submission, and low soundness should be backed up with serious objections to the work. The \"excitement\" score is more subjective, and its justification may not be reflected in the text. D. The review is rude/unprofessional E.

Their results suggest that about 50% of the accepted NeurIPS papers would have been rejected, had they simply been assigned to different reviewers. This is obviously a frustrating situation for the authors, going through rounds of arbitrary rejections.  Why does this happen? Here are a few possible culprits:  Variance in the experience of reviewers. Some reviews are by experienced reviewers and some are by novices; yet, to date there has been little effort to provide systematic training. Differences in understanding the key evaluation criteria. What counts as a “weakness” - a fundamental flaw or a lack of clarification experiment? What exactly does “overall recommendation” mean - the personal interest in the topic or how solid the research is? Just how much should different weaknesses “cost” the authors? Implicit biases that we all have due to our social and academic backgrounds. The same approach may receive different evaluation if it is tested on a popular or a niche task, on English or any other language, with focus on engineering or linguistic aspects, and if it had been preprinted by a well-known lab and received much attention.  This tutorial is part of an effort to improve the overall quality of reviews at ACL’23 conferences, aiming to address the above issues. Part I provides a general overview of the typical peer review process for the novice reviewers and authors; if you are familiar with this, feel free to skip this part. We are asking all reviewers and authors to read Part II, since it outlines the policies and review forms specific to ACL23. The reviewers need to adhere to the conference policies. The authors will be able to point to violations thereof in the author response, and the meta-reviewers will take that into account.

                            "content": "Am I qualified to review this?  As soon as you get an assignment, skim the paper to check whether this is something that you are qualified to review. The assignments are made based on a semi-automatic process, and, even with careful checks by the area chair / action editor, you may feel like you are not qualified to review a given submission.  Yet, even in the best-case scenario the matches will not always be perfect. For very novel work or atypical papers, it is inherently difficult to find available qualified reviewers. The possibility of a close match also depends on the set of people in the reviewing pool: a submission in a large and popular subfield is more likely to find the right reviewers. And even large subfields may experience a lack of well-matching reviewers when they are still actively growing. Moreover, sometimes a less obvious match may also be a conscious decision on the part of the chair/editor, e.g., to collect reviewers from different perspectives when the paper is interdisciplinary, or when it focuses on less popular topics and languages.  So, the bad news is that realistically, you will sometimes be asked to review papers that are a bit outside of your own subfield. That is ok and to be expected, as long as you are sufficiently familiar with the core methodology. If your expertise does not cover certain aspects of the submission, your review should specify that, and most NLP venues let you indicate your confidence score in the review form.  The good news is that the less-than-perfect matches also have upsides: you get to expand your repertoire, the authors get feedback on what needs more clarification/explanation, and NLP in general gets more intellectual exchange between subfields. Do I have a conflict of interest with this submission?  If the venue implements a fully or partially anonymous review process (*ACL conferences do), the second thing to check is whether you know or can guess who the authors are. The problem with implicit social biases is that they are unconscious; we may be 100% sure that we do not think worse of a paper just because it is written by someone from a group minoritized in computing research, and that we are not pre-disposed to like papers coming from famous labs, but we cannot really trust our conscious selves.  Thus, when you get the assignment, do check that anonymity is preserved. If it is not, the paper should be desk-rejected: contact your chair or action editor about this. You can also indicate that the paper should be desk-rejected if it does not follow the style guides or goes over the page limit (which does not include the ethical considerations section).  If anonymity is preserved, but you happen to know who the authors are from personal communication, social media or talks, ask for re-assignment if possible, especially if you have a conflict of interest (because you know the authors personally, have or will work with them etc.). For the papers where it is impossible to maintain anonymity (e.g., because they are too famous, or the authors are easy to guess for anyone who works in the same narrow subfield), the ACL policy is to indicate your awareness of the authors’ identity in the review form (more on that later).  The third check is on academic conflicts of interest. If the submission looks like something that is very close to your own work about to be submitted, it is best to recuse yourself. You can contact your senior area chair this way. "

If you are a novice reviewer, submitting your review early also gives your area chair / action editor the time to catch any grave issues.  How much time will you need? That varies by reviewer, paper, and experience. A way of estimating it would be to calculate what your average time for (a) an in-depth reading of a paper is that is as close to your area as the submission, (b) writing and editing about half a page of an article. You may also need to participate in the forum discussion with other reviewers before the reviews are sent to the authors.  If at all possible, reviewing should _not _be done in a single session. When you first read a paper, you may have a knee-jerk reaction to it that would make it harder to write a useful review. For example, you may fundamentally dislike the topic, or the method that was chosen, or the conclusions are at odds with what you already believe. It is best to read the paper and let it sink in for a few days, and then work on the review. If you write a first-impression draft at once, make sure to revisit it later."

                            "content": "Everybody’s process is different, but one strategy that seems to be often used, but not very well suited for peer review is commenting during the very first read. You do need to first at least skim the paper and understand the overall type of contribution and the framework in which the authors are working. If you do not do that, you are likely to start critiquing the paper from the perspective of a “prototypical” NLP paper in your area (e.g., an experimental paper proposing a SOTA system for English). That mental model might bias you against other types of contributions (e.g., resource papers, model or linguistic analysis, data processing/annotation strategies, reproduction studies, surveys, position pieces, negative results). Any study should be judged for what it is, and not for what you think it should be.  For experimental papers, a useful trick is to avoid looking at the results when first skimming the paper. When you start actually reading, carefully read the introduction and the methodology sections. After that, pause and ask yourself: is it clear what the research question is and what was done? Do you believe this would answer that question? Do you want to know the answer? Will the answer advance the field? Only then you should look at the results. This way you will be better able to focus on the knowledge gained in the paper: the result may be negative, but if you believe that the experiments are sound and the question worth asking, something that could save time to many others - this is also a valid contribution, as per the ACL call for papers.  Note whether the paper is long or short, and adjust your expectations accordingly. Long papers are supposed to describe completed work, with thorough evaluation and analysis. A short paper may present proof of concept, an interesting finding, a convincing point, but it is not expected to have extensive evaluation and analysis: only the minimal (but sufficiently convincing) evidence for the claim.  While you read, you may want to look up some references or concurrent work. This should be done cautiously: many papers have non-anonymous preprints, and you may accidentally discover the identity of authors, which would open you up to social biases. "

Let’s quickly go through them:  The authors: This is probably the reader that you’ll think about the most, and that’s good (you want to be respectful and thorough … they are your colleagues, so you should give the review you would like to receive). One thing to check is whether, after reading the review, the authors have a clear path forward on how to improve the paper: “not enough experiments” is far less actionable than “the results would be stronger with validation on the LDC NYT dataset”. Unlike all of the other readers we mention here, the authors will not see the discussion that happens on the review platform. While not everything from the discussion period should go into the review, the authors will see nothing of what happens in the discussion period, so if something new comes to light, make sure to modify your review so that the authors have all of the relevant information to revise their paper. Other reviewers: You’ll be able to read, compare, and contrast the reviews from the 3-4 other reviewers of the paper. One of the goals of your review is to spark discussion with the other reviewers, so it is okay to open a door for conversation on a particular topic either directly in your review or in the discussion period. Not all of the reviews need to be consistent, but they can and should interact. After reading other reviews, you can edit yours to say things specifically like “unlike Reviewer 2, I …” (remembering to be professional and constructive). The area chair (AC): The area chair is going to have to write a metareview of this paper. They won’t have time to read the paper as carefully as the reviewers will. So to make their life easier, make your review as specific and self-contained as possible. (We expand on this with examples below.) The senior area chair (SAC): Will have to calibrate the metareview of the AC against all the other papers in the area. They may not have read the paper, so the reviews need to be self-contained to know how this paper fits into the rest of the pool. "

Remember, the response is addressed not only by the reviewers but also to the chair.  The primary purpose of the author response period is to make sure that the reviewers understand the paper correctly. If the reviewer misunderstood the claims/contributions or is asking about something that is in fact stated in the paper, please state where.  If the reviewers ask to reframe the research questions or claims, or make some other changes that would be easy to do in the camera-ready version, please state how you will address that. Unfortunately, conferences are not well equipped to handle revisions, and it is up to the reviewers and chairs to be convinced or not.  If the reviewers are asking for experimental results that were not a part of the original submission, but that have been performed since the submission - this depends on a particular conference’s policy. ACL’23 disallows this. In some venues you may report such results, but the submission will still be evaluated for acceptance in its submission version. In your response, consider whether these results are necessary to back up the claims of your paper, or this is something nice to have but not a part of the central claim. In the former case such missing results are a weakness, in the latter - a suggestion/recommendation.  We highly encourage you to read part 2 of this review tutorial, especially the conference policy part. If you received a review that violates these policies, please flag this in the rebuttal form.  Finally - please, do respond to the reviews even if they are very negative. This should be done at least to thank the reviewers: they are volunteers who donated their time to read your work. If they were able to find serious issues with your work, this means that they really helped you to improve it and grow as a researcher. If there were issues with the review that fall under conference policy violations - by pointing it out you help to strengthen the peer review norms in the field, so that it happens less often in the future. And even if they simply misunderstood it, the process is mutually beneficial: you learned that the paper needs to be clearer to reach a broader audience, and if you clarify the misunderstanding, you’ll help the reviewers to grow.

The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case. This route is also available to prospective workshop authors whose submission sites have not opened yet. Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.  We are truly sorry that the current visa processing times for Canada are what they are, and that all we can do is help the participants start the applications as early as possible. We hope that the future conferences will not have similar issues.",

                    "introduction": "One of the big issues that authors often complain about at NLP conferences is “meh” reviews: the reviewer does not really find any significant problems with methodology or execution of the paper, but the overall recommendation is middling. This can be a symptom of paper-reviewer mismatch: the reviewer just is not sufficiently interested in the overall topic or approach, and hence no matter how good the paper is, it would not elicit much enthusiasm. In a recent survey of authors, reviewers and area chairs about their prior experience at NLP venues, many reviewers stated that “the area match was right, but…  the subject of the paper was not interesting to me (e.g. I would prefer another NLP task, model, or data)” (54%) the paper was not asking a research question that would be interesting for me” (45%)  At the same time, over 27% of the author respondents reported that they had experience of reviews where the reviewer was not interested in the subject of the paper.  While most recent * ACL conferences and ARR work with some version of an automated paper-reviewer matching system that computes affinity scores between the abstract and title of the submission and the candidate reviewer, based on their publication history. Interestingly, the same survey found that such automated score was overall the lowest ranking factor in paper-reviewer matching, according to the pool of authors, reviewers and area chairs.  A traditional alternative to affinity scores, that also addresses the issue with reviewer interest, is bidding: the reviewers explicitly say which papers they would be interested in. But this process is rather laborious: for a big track, a reviewer would need to indicate their interest for hundreds of papers. It also opens up the possibility of collusion rings.  To address this problem, ACL 2023 will experiment with a keywords-based workflow that explicitly targets two dimensions of submissions: contribution types and track sub-areas.",

                            "content": "This category aims to describe what kind of work is performed in this paper. Our classification is based on COLING 2018 paper types, with some modifications:  Computationally-aided linguistic analysis (of either models or data resources) NLP engineering experiment (most papers proposing methods to improve state-of-the-art) Approaches for data- and compute efficiency Reproduction study New data resources, particularly for low-resource languages Position papers Surveys Theory Publicly available software and pre-trained models  The contribution types cross-cut tracks, and we hope they would help to decrease the amount of cases where the reviewer just fundamentally does not recognize a certain type of work and hence scores it down, or has unreasonable expectations (e.g. experimental results in a position paper). Another goal of the contribution types mechanism is to help to create paper-reviewer assignments that consider different aspects of the paper. This does not always happen in the standard track-based assignment process.  For example, the category of compute/data-efficiency creates a de-facto equivalent of efficiency track spread across all tracks. Usually tracks are the only way to organize a group of reviewers with interest in a particular topic, but when that topic can be combined with other topics that also require specialized expertise, it becomes impossible to find good reviewer matches only within that track. For example, a paper proposing a QA system where the main contribution is not improvements in accuracy, but in efficiency, could be at a disadvantage in QA track - but a dedicated efficiency track might lack reviewers with expertise in QA.  If the contribution types mechanism is successful at ACL 2023, we hope that it will become more widely adopted in the future to ensure more fair reviews for different kinds of contributions within all tracks. It could also be further extended, e.g. to encourage the cross-track methods aiming for robustness, cognitive plausibility etc. "

                    "content": "Text generation models have been long available, and they are powering many existing tools assisting with input or the linguistic form of the text, like predictive keyboards or language checkers. However, the latest generation of models, exemplified by chatGPT and Galactica, is widely presented as something that handles both language and content: something that can produce long stretches of text of sufficient quality to serve as drafts of the user’s own work. This development is prompting schools, journals and conferences (including ICML) to update their authorship policies to address this trend.  Since these tools come from our own field, we are in the best position to appreciate their potential problems, including errors in the model output and potential plagiarism of the sources in the model’s training data. At a conference, the reviewers donate their time as volunteers, and they may wish to be assured that they are not expected to extra check for such problems. Furthermore, there is the authorship issue: ACL generally expects the content of its submissions to be original, unpublished work of named authors or acknowledged contributors. Per ACM definition of plagiarism, it includes not only verbatim or near-verbatim copying of the work of others, but also intentionally paraphrasing portions of another’s work.  In consultation with the ACL exec, ACL 2023 expands the mandatory Responsible NLP Checklist developed at NAACL 2022 by one more question concerning the use of writing assistants. If such tools were used in any way, the authors must elaborate on the scope and nature of their use. Like the other questions on providing code, data, compensating any participants and obtaining IRB approvals, this question is not meant for automatic desk-rejections. The purpose of this question, just like all others, is author reflection and establishment of research norms in the field. The authors’ answers to all questions in the checklist will be disclosed to the reviewers, who will then be free to flag a paper for case-by-case ethics review if they see a problem. In an effort to further improve transparency of NLP research for the general public, this year the authors’ answers to the responsible NLP checklist will also be made public as appendices to accepted papers, similarly to the reporting summaries published by Nature.  Here is our take on some cases frequently discussed in social media recently:\nA separate, but related issue is use of generative models for writing code. ACL submissions may be accompanied by code, which counts as supplementary materials that the reviewers are not obliged to check and consider, but they may do so if they wish. The use of code assistants such as Copilot is also a relatively new practice, and the norms around that are not fully established. For now, we ask the authors to acknowledge the use of such systems and the scope thereof, e.g. in the README files accompanying the code attachments or repositories. We also ask the authors to check for potential plagiarism.

                        "Assistance purely with the language of the paper. When generative models are used for paraphrasing or polishing the author’s original content, rather than for suggesting new content - they are similar to tools like Grammarly, spell checkers, dictionary and synonym tools, which have all been perfectly acceptable for years. If the authors are not sufficiently fluent to notice when the generated output does not match their intended ideas, using such tools without further checking could yield worse results than simpler-but-more-accurate English. The use of tools that only assist with language, like Grammarly or spell checkers, does not need to be disclosed.",
                        "Short-form input assistance. Even though predictive keyboards or tools like smart compose in google docs are also powered by generative language models, nobody objected to them, since hardly anyone would try to use them to generate a long, unique and coherent text: it would simply not be practical. Similarly to language tools above, the use of such tools does not need to be disclosed in response to the writing assistance question.",
                        "Literature search. Generative text models may be used as search assistants, e.g. to identify relevant literature. However, we expect the authors to read and discuss such references, just like the references identified by a regular search engine or a semantic literature recommendation tool. The usual requirements for citation accuracy and thoroughness of literature reviews apply; beware of the possible biases in suggested citations.",
                        "Low-novelty text. Some authors may feel that describing widely known concepts is a waste of their time and can be automated. They should specify where such text was used, and convince the reviewers that the generation was checked to be accurate and is accompanied by relevant and appropriate citations (e.g., using block quotes for verbatim copying). If the generation copies text verbatim from existing work, the authors need to acknowledge all relevant citations: both the source of the text used and the source of the idea(s).",
                        "New ideas. If the model outputs read to the authors as new research ideas, that would deserve co-authorship or acknowledgement from a human colleague, and that the authors then developed themselves (e.g. topics to discuss, framing of the problem) - we suggest acknowledging the use of the model, and checking for known sources for any such ideas to acknowledge them as well. Most likely, they came from other people’s work.",
                        "New ideas + new text: a contributor of both ideas and their execution seems to us like the definition of a co-author, which the models cannot be. While the norms around the use of generative AI in research are being established, we would discourage such use in ACL submissions. If you choose to go down this road, you are welcome to make the case to the reviewers that this should be allowed, and that the new content is in fact correct, coherent, original and does not have missing citations. Note that, as our colleagues at ICML point out, currently it is not even clear who should take the credit for the generated text: the developers of the model, the authors of the training data, or the user who generated it."

While the current systems perform much better and fail more gracefully than their rule-based predecessors, there are growing piles of evidence of other kinds of brittleness, including out-of-domain generalization, adversarial attacks, spurious patterns (both linguistic and social), lack of sensitivity to basic linguistic perturbations such as negation, over-sensitivity to perturbations that should not matter (e.g. order and wording of prompts), etc.\n\nThe theme track invites empirical and theoretical research, as well as position and survey papers reflecting on the ways in which reported performance improvements on NLP benchmarks are meaningful. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\nHow reliably do the leaderboard scores translate to improvements in real-world use of the models?\nHow reliably do the leaderboard scores compare competing models?\nWhile the current NLP systems are not brittle in the same way as their predecessors, they are still brittle in other ways. What tasks can we claim to have “solved”, if any?\nHave performance improvements been accompanied by commensurate growth in the scientific understanding (of language, cognition, or deep learning technology)? In what ways?\nGiven that the authors of engineering papers are incentivized to report only the most successful results, especially for the systems that are also commercial products, what can the NLP venues do to improve reporting?\n\nThe theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards."

Long papers may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references and appendices. Final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to nine (9) pages), so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.\n\nShort paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a small, focused contribution - a point that can be made in a few pages with sufficient level of detail. Short papers may consist of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references and appendices. Final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to five (5) pages), so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.\n\nBoth short and long papers are submitted through the same process, but they will be reviewed using a different review form and criteria. Short and long papers will be distinguished in the proceedings, but the length of the paper does not correspond to either the final presentation format (poster or oral), or the type of contribution made in the paper. In particular, ACL 2023 welcomes the following kinds of contributions:\n\nComputationally-aided linguistic analysis (of either models or data resources)\nNLP engineering experiment\nReproduction study\nNew data resources, particularly for low-resource languages\nApproaches for data- and compute efficiency\nPosition papers\nSurveys\nPublicly available software and pre-trained models\n\nWhile there is no direct mapping between types of contributions and paper length, some kinds of papers naturally gravitate towards a certain length: e.g. surveys are more likely to be long rather than short papers.

A given submission may only choose one of these two options, i.e. it is not possible to submit a paper to ACL directly while being under review at ARR and vice versa.\n\nThe papers submitted directly to ACL will have the “regular” review process: a paper is reviewed by 3 reviewers, and authors are invited to write an author response and revise their paper before the camera-ready deadline, if accepted. The deadline for submitting papers through the START system is January 13, 2023.\n\nPapers submitted to ACL 2023, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics. The notifications for the main track and Findings will come out simultaneously, and the authors of submissions accepted to Findings may opt to withdraw until May 8.\n\nARR papers committed to ACL will be handled by the Senior Area Chairs. For these papers, the authors may provide an author response but not revise their paper (with the exception of adding the required “Limitations” section, if it is missing from the ARR submission; see below).\n\nTo be considered by ACL 2023, ARR papers need to be submitted to ARR and obtain all its reviews and meta-review by the commitment deadline of March 17. These papers cannot be modified except that they can be associated with an author response. They also cannot be revised and re-submitted to ARR for a new review cycle while they are considered by ACL 2023.\n\nNote: Generally, to receive reviews by the commitment deadline, the regular ARR timeline suggests that ARR suggestions should be made by December 15th. Note that the cycle length will change in December to 8 weeks.\n\nIf you have submitted a paper to ARR but do not want to use the review result of ARR, it must be inactive in the ARR system in order for the paper to be submitted directly to ACL. This means that the submission must either be explicitly withdrawn by the authors, or the ARR reviews are finished and shared with the authors before January 1st, 2023, and the paper was not re-submitted to ARR. Authors can withdraw a paper from ARR by January 1st, regardless of how many reviews they have received, and submit the paper directly to ACL 2023.\n\nPapers submitted to ACL 2023 may not be submitted for review elsewhere (including ARR) while being under review at ACL 2023. However, we allow an exception of the multiple submission policy for papers under review for EACL 2023 and ICLR 2023. See the Multiple Submission Policy below."

                                "Anonymity Period": "The direct submissions to ACL may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after December 20 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to publication time, not submission time). The respective deadline for ARR is November 15th. Non-anonymous preprints that were published before the start of the anonymity period may not be updated until ACL notifications come out. The only exception is for the purpose of correcting names, in which case the PC chairs should be notified per ACL policy. The existence of non-anonymous preprints must be disclosed in the submission form.\nACL does not prohibit giving talks about work under review in small groups, but we ask you not to advertise the preprint (or such talks) on social media, blog about this work, or have it covered in the media during the anonymity period. Anonymous preprints (e.g. on ARR) can be posted after the start of the anonymity period, but likewise should not be advertised by their authors or their close colleagues, as that can compromise the review process.",
                                "Anonymization for Double-blind Review": "The submissions to ACL and any supplementary materials must not include authors’ names and affiliations, or the acknowledgments section. Self-references that reveal the authors’ identities must be avoided. For example, instead of “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” or even “We previously showed (Anonymous, 1991)… “ please use “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”.\nThe submissions should avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Please avoid any links to storage services like Dropbox (which may track the reviewers downloading the resources). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.",

                                "Optional Supplementary Materials (Appendices, Software, Data)": "See the policy in the ARR CFP. Papers should not refer for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. If important citations are not available to reviewers (e.g., awaiting publication), these paper/s should be anonymised and included in the appendix. They can then be referenced from the submission without compromising anonymity.",
                                "Paper Formatting": "Both long and short papers must follow the ACL 2023 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded in Style Files and Formatting. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review. We recommend using the ACL Pubcheck tool to confirm that your submission conforms to the standards prior to submission, so as to avoid desk rejections.",
                                "Mandatory discussion of limitations": "We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. ACL 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review.\n\nAn ARR-reviewed paper that did not include “Limitations” section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their ACL 2023 submission. We treat ARR papers with and without the Limitations section equally if the Limitation section is provided in the paper or as an additional PDF.\n\nWhile we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative. In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.",
                                "Ethics Statement": "Scientific work published at ACL 2023 must comply with the ACL Code of Ethics. We encourage all authors to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of the work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).",
                                "Responsible NLP Checklist": "ACL 2023 submissions are required to fill the Responsible NLP checklist in the paper submission form (not as a supplementary pdf file, like before) that covers reproducibility and ethical considerations. We encourage the authors to have a look at the Responsible NLP checklist as early as possible in the cycle of their project, to make sure that any necessary IRB permissions are obtained, experiment parameters are saved, and energy expenditure is estimated. The checklist will include one new question asking to disclose the use of AI writing assistants, if any.",
                                "Multiple Submission Policy": "In principle, papers submitted directly to ACL must not be under review for any other archival venue at any time during the ACL review process. We will not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. However, considering the overlap of the paper submission due and the notification of acceptance of EACL 2023 and ICLR 2023, we allow an exception for the multiple submission policy; a work under review for EACL 2023 or ICLR 2023 can be submitted to ACL, but must be declared at submission time. If the work is accepted, it must be withdrawn from ACL no later than January 31 (when accepted to EACL 2023) and no later than January 22 (when accepted to ICLR 2023). Papers submitted to ICLR 2023 and ACL 2023 must follow the anonymization policy of ACL 2023.",
                                "Optional: Sticky Reviews": "The papers previously reviewed at other *ACL venues (but not through ARR) have the option to submit the paper together with the link to the previous Softconf START submission, from which the track chairs will be able to access the old reviews. They will also be able to submit a short explanation of how the paper was changed in response to the old reviews. This option could be beneficial for the authors who have addressed the problems identified before, and can argue strongly for how the paper has been improved. The prior reviews will not be seen by the new reviewers, but they may be used by the area chairs and program chairs in review quality control, resolving disagreements between reviewers, and in deciding borderline papers.",
                                "Cross-submissions with ACL Workshops": "The papers submitted for reviewing directly to ACL 2023 and not selected by the main conference will be able to submit to ACL 2023 workshops after the ACL notifications, with the reviews and meta-reviews they received at ACL. Papers accepted to Findings can also apply for presentation at participating workshops. The deadlines for direct submission to be reviewed by the workshops will be determined by the individual workshops."

It should accompany all submissions, and its goal is to present structured information about the ethics and reproducibility aspects of the study. It will be available for the reviewers, as well as any future readers of the paper. Especially for the junior authors, we strongly suggest that they consider the checklist at the early stages of their project, rather than treating such questions as an afterthought.\n\nShould the reviewers still have concerns about the ethical aspects of a given submission, it may be passed on to the ACL ethics committee for extra ethics review. ACL reserves the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work."

The development of many of these technologies trace their roots to academic and industrial research laboratories where researchers invented a plethora of algorithms, benchmarked them against shared datasets and perfected the performance of these algorithms to provide plausible solutions to real-world applications. While a controlled laboratory setting is vital for a deeper scientific understanding of the problems underlying language technologies and the impact of algorithmic design choices on the performance of a technology, transitioning the technology to real-world industrial-strength applications raises a different and challenging set of technical issues.\n\nWe invite submissions describing innovations and implementations in all areas of speech and natural language processing technologies and systems that are relevant to real-word applications. The primary focus of this track is on papers that advance the understanding of, and demonstrate the effective handling of, practical issues related to the deployment of language processing technologies in non-trivial real-world systems. By “non-trivial real-world system” we mean an application that is deployed for real-world use, i.e., outside controlled environments such as laboratories, classrooms or experimental crowd-sourced setups, and that uses natural language processing (including speech technology), even if not state-of-the-art in terms of research. There is no requirement that the system be made by a for-profit company, but the users of the system are most likely outside the NLP research community.",

We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. Where a paper may raise ethical issues, we ask that you include in the paper an explicit discussion of these issues, which will be taken into account in the review process. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work.\n\nAuthors will be allowed extra space after the 6th page for an optional broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. The ACL review form will include a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers or Senior Area Chairs will be further reviewed by an ethics committee. Note that an ethical considerations section is not required, but papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks that do not discuss these issues will not be accepted. Conversely, the mere inclusion of an ethical considerations section does not guarantee acceptance. In addition to acceptance or rejection, papers may receive a conditional acceptance recommendation. Camera-ready versions of papers designated as conditional accept will be re-reviewed by the ethics committee to determine whether the concerns have been adequately addressed. Please read the Ethics FAQ for more guidance on some problems to look out for and key concerns to consider relative to the code of ethics.",

(2) Is the main contribution of the paper related to a deployment aspect of the application, such as considerations of speed, robustness, usability, or some problem that was discovered during deployment that your results begin to address but more research effort would be required to solve more comprehensively? If so, the Industry Track might be a better fit. (3) Does the paper report new state-of-the-art on a task that is likely to be feasible and interesting outside of your specific setting? If so, the NLP Applications Track might be a better fit. (4) Is your system evaluated only on usability subjects? If so, the NLP Applications Track might be a better fit."

                        "Submission Guidelines": "All submissions should be made electronically via START. Please note that the submission platform is different from the one used by the main conference.\n\nUse this link to make your submission: https://www.softconf.com/acl2023/demos\n\nSubmissions must include the following:\n\n(1) A paper describing the motivation and the technical details of the system, including visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams). See examples of recently accepted demo papers in ACL 2022, NAACL 2022, EMNLP 2022, ACL 2021, NAACL 2021 and EMNLP 2021.\n\nThe papers must be no more than six (6) pages long, plus unlimited extra space for an optional ethics/broader impact statement and also unlimited space for references. Please use the main ACL 2023 paper style files. Accepted papers will be given one additional page of content, so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.\n\nAny papers that do not follow the official style guidelines and page limits will be automatically rejected.\n\n(2) A short (max. 2 minutes) video demonstrating the system. This video will be used to evaluate the paper, but it will not be published unless requested.\n\nA screencast with audio narration is a natural choice for demos that can be presented on a screen. Otherwise, a video of a user interacting with the system can be used.\n\nThe production quality of the video is not of interest. Hence, we encourage the videos to be simply a screencast of the software that is getting demoed, with zero to minimal editing efforts.\n\nWe recommend that you publish your video on YouTube or another website and include the link in your paper. If you prefer not to publicly upload a screencast, please submit the video (in MPEG4 format). The video must be included as supplementary material when you submit your paper through START.\n\nIn addition, we strongly recommend that all demos be made available via one of the following formats: (a) a live demo website, or (b) a website with a downloadable installation package of the demo. We understand though that this might be impossible, e.g., when special hardware is required or when access is otherwise limited.",
                        "Submission Policy": "The demo paper has to be original, written specifically for this conference and cannot be submitted elsewhere. The paper must also report on a substantial improvement (>30%), if the system that is being described has been reported elsewhere before.\n\nAuthors submitting more than one demo paper to ACL 2023 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other. Submissions of identical or closely related work to multiple tracks at ACL 2023 (Research, SRW, Industry, or Demo) will be rejected by all tracks.",
                        "Reviewing Policy": "Reviewing will be single-blind, and thus authors do not need to conceal their identity. Thus, the demo papers should include the authors’ names and affiliations. Self-references are also allowed. Relevant papers that meet formatting requirements will be assessed on the basis of their relevance to the demo track, contribution, clarity, completeness, and novelty.",
                        "Ethics Policy": "Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACM Code of Ethics. The consideration of the ethical impact of our research, use of data, and potential applications of our work has always been an important consideration, and as artificial intelligence is becoming more mainstream, these issues are increasingly pertinent. We ask that all authors read the code, and ensure that their work is conformant to this code. We reserve the right to reject papers on ethical grounds, where the authors are judged to have operated counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns about their work.\n\nAuthors will be allowed extra space after the 6th page for a broader impact statement or other discussion of ethics. The ACL demonstration review form will include a section addressing these issues and papers flagged for ethical concerns by reviewers will be further reviewed by an ethics committee. Note that an ethical considerations section is not required, but papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks that do not discuss these issues will not be accepted. Conversely, the mere inclusion of an ethical considerations section does not guarantee acceptance. In addition to acceptance or rejection, papers may receive a conditional acceptance recommendation. Camera-ready versions of papers designated as conditional accept will be re-reviewed by the ethics committee to determine whether the concerns have been adequately addressed. Please read the ethics FAQ (shared with the main conference) for more guidance on some problems to look out for and key concerns to consider relative to the code of ethics.",

All archival papers will be published in the ACL 2023 SRW Proceedings. Non-archival papers may be submitted to any venue in the future except for another SRW. The submission links are on our website.

Publishing a paper in an ACL SRW workshop can be really helpful for improving students’ publication record.\nExplorative Studies: We encourage the submission of studies with positive and negative results providing insights on why and in which scenarios a particular method succeeds and fails.\n\nAll accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions, which will give students an opportunity to interact with and to present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field and assigned mentors."

The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student’s work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.\n\nStudents wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft by March 10, 2023.\n\nNote that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check for the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.\n\nThe participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.\n\nYou CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper. The submission website will have separate tracks for pre-submission mentorship and the final paper submission."

Once you have received this Acceptance notification you will receive a special link to register in which your registration fees are waived. Additionally, a separate email containing a Volunteer Registration form will be sent to you, in which you can list what volunteer preference task you would like based on your skillset (i.e. registration, volunteer coordinator, poster session liaison etc.). This form must be completed FIRST in order to receive the ACL Conference 2023 LINK to have registration fees waived. If for any reason you are not accepted, the Registrar will work with you to secure early registration fee rates. In the case that a student requires reimbursement after the conference for LATE volunteer registration, the student must provide receipt of paid registration fees from debit or bank account (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Assistant Director of Events, Megs Haddad (acl.megshaddad@gmail.com).\n\nStudents are required to fill out the Volunteer Reimbursement Form that will be available once selected. In this form, please attach proof of all receipts to be refunded. Preferred refund method for in person conference attendance is Cash at the event (if the form is complete and all receipts are turned in). If this is not possible, a valid mailing address is required to receive a reimbursement check, a valid email address required for PayPal payments, or complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in the event that check reimbursement is not possible).",

                        "Registration and ACL Membership Subsidies": "This is for getting a waiver for ACL registration. You can also request ACL membership if applicable. You will be asked to justify your application. For instance, you can say:\n\n“I have an accepted paper at the main conference. I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver because my fees are not funded by my organization/institution.”\n“I have an accepted paper at an ACL Workshop/ the SRW/ SemEval shared task, I live in a developing country [name the country] and I/my institution cannot afford the registration fees.”\n\nNote that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, you SHOULD NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&I subsidy application. That way, you would not have to ask for a reimbursement, since you would not be charged in the first place.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we will take your justification into account when processing your application.",
                        "Travel and Accommodation Subsidies": "We are also providing travel and accommodation subsidies. Priority will be given to authors, first-time attendees and folks from underrepresented communities with financial hurdles.\n\nIf you would like to attend the in-person meeting please keep in mind that if your waiver application is accepted, We are only able to pay in advance for some rooms at the conference hotel (the price needs to be included in the amount of money that you are requesting). Other accommodations and travel expenses (e.g., flight tickets) can only be reimbursed after the conference.\n\nThe number of accepted applicants and the amount of money subsidized will vary depending on the number of applicants and the funding availability.\n\nPlease answer questions regarding whether you have previously attended any *CL conferences (NAACL, EACL, AACL, ACL, EMNLP and COLING) accurately as we would like to give all first-time attendees a chance.",

These can be babysitting, transportation costs, or other support required for yourself or your dependents, which would ease your participation. If you need any personal or technical assistance to access and navigate the conference due to a disability, we can reimburse it (e.g., if you need assistance in using gather.town due to visual impairment).\n\nWe acknowledge that accessibility needs are highly individual to each participant, so please feel free to reach out to us with any issues you might face in this regard. When justifying your caregiving and accessibility subsidy application, you can say for example: “As a caregiver, I would like to apply for a subsidy of $$ USD to take care of my child when I will be presenting my work at the conference.”",
                        "Bandwidth and VPN Subsidies": "We can reimburse bandwidth or VPN expenses that you need for the conferences. You need to provide receipts for your expenses. Bandwidth subsidies would be for high-speed internet access costs for the duration of the conference only. VPN generally does not cost more than 10 USD per month and could be applied towards participation if you need anonymity to participate completely. A justification example can be:\n\n“I am from a remote village where I depend on my cellular internet. I would need $$ USD to increase my quote as my current plan is not suitable for video conferencing (add a link to the tariff of your internet subscriber if possible).”\n“I worry about my safety and privacy because … and I would like to apply for a VPN subsidy of $$ USD to avoid surveillance (link to the service provider if possible).”",

Privacy will be respected and preference will be given to first-time attendees and applicants from underrepresented groups who are presenting a paper at the main conference/the Student Research Workshop,/any of the workshops associated with ACL, and those who do not have other means of support. As the conference will be hybrid and we are aware of the current Canadian Visa issues that people from underrepresented groups are dealing with, we may provide more virtual waivers than travel grants to help as many people as possible.",

                    "Submission Information": "Proposals should be submitted as PDF documents. Note that submissions should be ready to be turned into a Call for Papers to the workshop within one week of notification.\n\nThe proposals should be at most two pages for the main proposal and at most two additional pages for information about the organizers, program committee, and references. Thus, the whole proposal should not be more than four pages long.\n\nThe two pages for the main proposal must include:\n\nA title and a brief description of the workshop topic and content.\nA list of invited speakers, if applicable, with an indication of which ones have already agreed and which are indicative, and sources of funding for the speakers.\nAn estimate of the number of attendees.\nDepending on the global situation of COVID-19, some conferences might take place only virtually. We request submissions to contain a brief discussion on measures planned to make sure a workshop is successful and productive in case of a virtual-only attendance.\nA description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop, and estimate of the number of participants.\nA description of special requirements and technical needs.\nThe preferred venue(s) (EACL / ACL / EMNLP), if any, and description of any constraints (e.g., if the workshop is compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically or otherwise)\nIf the workshop has been held before, a note specifying where previous workshops were held, how many submissions the workshop received, how many papers were accepted (also specify if they were not regular papers, e.g., shared task system description papers), and how many attendees the workshop attracted.\n\nNote that the only financial support available to workshops is a single free workshop registration for an invited speaker. The workshop organizers must bear all other costs independently.\n\nThe two pages for information about organizers, program committee, and references must include:\n\nThe names, affiliations, and email addresses of the organizers, with a brief statement (2-5 sentences) of their research interests, areas of expertise, and experience in organizing workshops and related events.\nA list of Program Committee members, with an indication of which members have already agreed. Organizers should do their best to estimate the number of submissions (especially for recurring workshops) in order to (a) ensure a sufficient number of reviewers so that each paper receives 3 reviews, and (b) anticipate that no one is committed to reviewing more than 3 papers. This practice is likely to ensure on-time and thoughtful reviews.\nAn indication whether the workshop will consider papers submitted through ACL Rolling Review (ARR); an indication whether the workshop will use OpenReview as a platform (both to take papers from ARR and for their own review); whether the workshop will only use START as a platform, and will not use ARR. In making this choice, please pay careful attention to the ARR deadlines and conference notifications.\nReferences\n\nSubmission is electronic at the following link: https://softconf.com/n/acl-workshops2023.\n\nThe workshop proposals will be evaluated according to their originality and impact, and the quality of the organizing team and Programme Committee.",
                    "Diversity and Inclusion": "The proposals should describe the ways in which the workshop will support diversity in NLP. We suggest organizers consider the following points, while developing the proposal:\n\nContribution to academic diversity: The proposals could explain how the subject matter of the workshop will contribute to the diversity of the field, e.g. use of multilingual data, indications of how the described methods scale up to various languages or domains, accessibility of resources, supporting underrepresented communities of NLP and so on.\nDiversifying representation: Following the WiNLP initiative, we recognize the current problems of demographic imbalance in the field. Therefore, we particularly encourage submissions including members of under-represented groups in computational linguistics. The proposals should describe how their selection of invited speakers, panelists, organizers, and program committee promotes diverse representation (for example, considering underrepresented demographics based on gender, ethnicity, nationality, and so on). We also suggest including speakers and panelists, who have not appeared as a keynote speaker or panelist in recent conferences.\nDiversifying participation: The proposals could describe how the call-for-papers and outreach will encourage people from marginalized groups to attend and submit to the workshop. Some examples include providing mentoring, subsidies, coordinating with affinity groups, diversifying the selection of papers and so on.",
                    "Organizer Responsibilities": "The organizers of the accepted proposals will be responsible for publicizing and running the workshop, including reviewing submissions, producing the camera-ready workshop proceedings, organizing the meeting days, and playing their part to ensure that all participants are aware of ACL’s anti-harassment policy. It is crucial that organizers commit to all deadlines. In particular, failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the unified proceedings and author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timelines for each of the conferences are given below. The workshop organizers should not deviate from this schedule unless absolutely necessary, and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs.\n\nThe ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find the ACL’s general policies on workshops, the financial policy for workshops, and the financial policy for SIG workshops in the Conference Handbook.",

We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals for two types of tutorials: ​\n\nCutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list of tutorials in the past 4 years).\nIntroductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques).\n\nIn both cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.\n\nTutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues: ​\n\nEACL 2023 in Dubrovnik, Croatia (hybrid) on May 2-6, 2023.\nACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada (hybrid) on July 9-14, 2023.\nEMNLP 2023 in Singapore on TBD, 2023.",

The overall diversity of the tutorial organizers and potential audience will be taken into account to ensure that the conference program is varied and balanced.\n\nTutorial proposals should describe and will be evaluated according to how the tutorial contributes to topics promoting diversity (e.g., working on minority languages, developing NLP for good), participation diversity (e.g., coordinating with social affinity groups, providing subsidies, making a promotional plan for the tutorial), and representation diversity among tutorial presenters. For more information or advice, organizers may consult resources such as the BIG directory, Black in AI, Disability in AI, Indigenous AI, LatinX in AI, Masakhane, 500 Queer Scientists, and Women-in-ML’s directory.",

Findings papers presented at workshops need to register, at a minimum, at the appropriate workshop-only rate."

Having this available on Underline allows remote participants to also view the questions and then ask questions on RocketChat. Due to the limitations of the venue, we can only offer a short spotlight presentation to authors in person, but the virtual poster session will allow for synchronous Q&A from all ACL 2023 participants.

Reviewers need to download the papers, and not everyone has a strong internet connection at all times. If you need more than this, consider using compression or lower resolution on images in your paper (for raster images) and removing polygons (for vector images). You can also reencode your PDF."

More concretely, the validation script checks to make sure that there’s nothing in the margins. The extra numbers to aid reviewing violates the checker.

However, if de-anonymization on withdrawal results in the paper being de-anonymized for the first time, the paper would violate the ACL anonymity policies.

If your leaderboard shows your institution, e-mail, or real-life name, then pointing to the leaderboard would violate anonymity (you can still report the score in the paper, though). If the leaderboard just has the name of the model (which is independent of your institution), then there is no problem."

Intelligence and agency are the wrong categories for understanding them. Instead, these Al systems are what we might call cultural technologies, like writing, print, libraries, internet search engines or even language itself. They are new techniques for passing on information from one group of people to another. Cultural technologies arent like intelligent humans, but they are essential for human intelligence. Many animals can transmit some information from one individual or one generation to another, but no animal does it as much as we do or accumulates as much information over time, . New technologies that make cultural transmission easier and more effective have been among the greatest engines of human progress, but they have also led to negative as well as positive social consequences. Moreover, while cultural technologies allow transmission of existing information cultural evolution, which is central to human success, also depends on innovation, exploration and causal learning. Comparing LLM’s responses in prompts based on developmental psychology experiments to the responses of children may provide insight into which capacities can be learned through language and cultural transmission, and which require innovation and exploration in the physical world. I will present results from several studies making such comparisons.",

So, this year we have a total of 3 best papers, 4 special awards papers (Resource Award, Social Impact Award, Reproduction Award, Theme Paper Award)—and 39 outstanding papers! Additionally, there are Area Chair Awards: the Senior Area Chairs of each track had the opportunity to nominate one of their papers for a separate award. Many thanks to our Best Paper Committee for helping us with the selection process!\nThis page lists all the awards and honorable mentions, as well as demo track and SRW awards. But we congratulate everybody who was considered for the award: only 1.6% papers were even nominated by the reviewers. Next year, let’s all be more generous with nominations!",

                        "introduction": "Arguably the biggest source of issues with peer review quality is the lack of incentives to invest more work in invisible service labor, and improving the incentives for that was one of the missions of ACL’23.\n\nWith support of ACL exec, we are pleased to announce the inaugural round of ACL reviewer awards, which will be comparable in scope to the best paper awards policy (1-1.5% of the pool of reviewers and chairs). Besides serving as a token of community recognition, and they come with a special award: a fee waiver for any *ACL virtual conference, to be used within a year of the award. Since most academic institutions cover attendance for the conferences where their affiliated authors have accepted papers—but not other conferences—-we hope that this will allow the awardees to attend more conferences than they would otherwise, and the benefit of the award will thus be received by them rather than by their host institutions.\n\nThe reviewers are nominated for awards by their area chairs, whom we asked to recognize the reviewers providing extra helpful reviews or high-quality emergency reviews, “champion’’ reviewers, and reviewers who were particularly active in the discussion phase, and demonstrated exceptional open-mindedness or expertise. We also asked the Senior Area chairs to nominate exceptional area chairs, and finally we as PCs also nominated the SACs of the track that was the most on-time with its tasks, provided the most helpful feedback, and followed our instructions the most closely. In total, we have 67 awards.\n\nHere’s a few of our favorite reviewer nomination pitches:\n\nAlthough the paper was neither sound nor exciting, they took the time to write very specific and detailed comments along with constructive feedback and suggestions.\n\nThey wrote good enthusiastic reviews and actively participated in the discussion, acknowledging and taking into account other reviewers, as well as clarifying their own stance.\n\nThis reviewer not only submitted thorough and helpful review, but also followed up on the authors’ response and provided convincing arguments for why the paper should be accepted.\n\nThey responded very promptly, humbly, and with an open mind to my request to fix some review policy issues before the author response. As a result, they revised their review to be very balanced while keeping a friendly and encouraging tone.\n\nThis reviewer did a thorough emergency review in one day, she is a hero :)\n\nThey volunteered to do an emergency review and wrote detailed reviews for both papers they reviewed in my batch. Additionally, they proactively started discussing with the other reviewers after the rebuttal, pushing back on some of the other reviewers’ criticism that was unjustified also in my opinion.\n\nAnd AC nomination pitches:\n\n… had read at least two papers herself to make a more informed decision. In one case this led to noticing reviewers’ misunderstanding/mistakes and saved the submission.\n\nThorough summaries, engagement in the reviewers’ discussions, clear stands on the papers.\n\nThis area chair proactively completed all assigned duties well in time, moderated discussions promptly, and even maintained a log of interactions with late reviewers to chase them for completing their tasks in time. He also declared potential COIs upfront, so as to avoid later conflicts.\n\nOn behalf of ourselves and the authors - thanks for your help!",

                        "What is the ACL and what is Computational Linguistics?": "The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics or natural language processing (NLP). The association was founded in 1962, originally named the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL), and became the ACL in 1968. Activities of the ACL include the holding of an annual meeting each summer and the sponsoring of the journal Computational Linguistics, published by MIT Press; this conference and journal are the leading publications of the field. For more information, see: https://www.aclweb.org/. ​",
                        "What is Computational Linguistics?": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few."

                        "introduction": "By registering, participants acknowledge and agree to follow the ACL’s code of ethics, the ACL’s anti-harassment policy, and the ACL code of conduct below. Violations against those should be reported to the Professional Conduct Committee by approaching any of its members.",
                        "ACL Code of Conduct": "The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of the ACL. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.\n\nHarassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken."
