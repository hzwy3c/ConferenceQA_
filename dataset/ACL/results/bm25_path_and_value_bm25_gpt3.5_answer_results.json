These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.\n\nHarassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.", "response": "I don't know."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What requests are needed for visa letter?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_5>>title>>Attending ACL 2023 on-site: visa information": 0, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_502>>title>>Know What I don’t Know: Handling Ambiguous and Unknown Questions for Text-to-SQL": 0, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_649>>title>>Investigating Glyph-Phonetic Information for Chinese Spell Checking: What Works and What’s Next?": 0, "ACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>content>>Important Dates>>content>>All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).": 0, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>Papers>>Papers_24>>title>>Distilled Language Models are economically efficient for the enterprise. …mostly.": 0}, "from": "ACL2023/Participants/Participants Information/Invitation Letter/content", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
