First, they are seeking Cutting-edge tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any related tutorial from ACL, EMNLP, EACL, NAACL-HLT, AACL, or COLING in the past 4 years. Second, they are interested in Introductory tutorials that provide introductions to related fields potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community, such as linguistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning techniques. The aim of a tutorial is to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome if they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations."}]
