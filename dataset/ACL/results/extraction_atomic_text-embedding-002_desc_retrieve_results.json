Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.\n\nStudents wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft by March 10, 2023.\n\nNote that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check for the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.\n\nThe participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.\n\nYou CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper.

Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few.": 0.0823013186454773, "ACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>About ACL>>content>>What is the ACL and what is Computational Linguistics?>>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics or natural language processing (NLP).

It is crucial that organizers commit to all deadlines. In particular, failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the unified proceedings and author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timelines for each of the conferences are given below. The workshop organizers should not deviate from this schedule unless absolutely necessary, and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs.\n\nThe ACL has a set of policies on workshops.
