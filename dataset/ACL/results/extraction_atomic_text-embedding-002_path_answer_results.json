They also welcome opinion/vision papers related to real-world applications."}, {"query": "What is ACL student research workshop?", "output": "The ACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) is a forum organized by the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) for students who are investigating various areas of Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning. The workshop is designed to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior, and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research. This provides an excellent opportunity for participants to present their work and receive mentorship and valuable feedback from the international research community. The workshop includes a mentorship program, offers opportunities for improving publication records, and encourages the submission of explorative studies. Accepted work is presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions."}, {"query": "What is Computational Linguistics?", "output": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics can be motivated from a scientific perspective in trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon, or it may be motivated from a technological perspective in wanting to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. The work of computational linguists is incorporated into many systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, and language instruction materials."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of regisration?", "output": "The cancellation policy for registration is as follows. If you cancel your registration one month or more prior to the conference, specifically by June 9, 2023, you will be refunded the full amount you paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee. If you cancel up to three weeks prior to the conference, on or before June 16, 2023, you will be refunded the ACL membership fee (if it was paid as part of the registration) and anything paid over the first $200. Any cancellations made two weeks prior to the start of the conference on June 23, 2023, and any no-shows, will not be given any refund. However, you will still be able to keep your full-year ACL membership and have access to the conference virtually. Exceptions are given for governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference. In these cases, a full refund will be given regardless of when the ACL Office is notified, but documentation supporting the reasons for cancellation must be provided. A processing fee up to $50 might still apply."}]
