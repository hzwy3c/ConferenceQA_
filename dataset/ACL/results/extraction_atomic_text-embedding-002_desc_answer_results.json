Additionally, they cannot accept submissions for publication that will be or have been published elsewhere. They are also in charge of staying on track with the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers and the preparation of camera-ready copies, which are different for each conference. Deviations from this schedule should only be done if necessary and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs."}, {"query": "What is Computational Linguistics?", "output": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. The work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of regisration?", "output": "The cancellation policy for registration is as follows: registration cancelled one month or more prior to the conference, that is on June 09, 2023, or before, will be refunded the full amount paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee.

Cancellations made two weeks prior to the start of the conference, on June 23, 2023, as well as no-shows will not be refunded any amount, but they will retain the full year ACL membership (if it was paid as part of the registration) and have virtual access. Exceptions to these rules include cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to get a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference. In these cases, they will be refunded the full amount paid, reducing a $50 processing fee, regardless of when notification is received by the ACL Office. Documentation supporting the exception must be submitted."}]
