Its goal is to aid students at multiple stages of their education, including undergraduate, MSc/MA, junior and senior PhD students, in getting familiar with conducting and presenting their research."}, {"query": "What is Computational Linguistics?", "output": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“handcrafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Computational linguists' work is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, among others."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of regisration?", "output": "The cancellation policy of registration is as follows: \n\n- If you cancel one month or more prior to the conference (on or before June 09, 2023), you will be refunded the full amount paid, but a processing fee up to $50 may be deducted. \n- If you cancel up to three weeks prior to the conference (on or before June 16, 2023), you will be refunded the ACL membership fee (if it was paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200.\n- If you cancel 2 weeks prior to the start of the conference (on or before June 23, 2023) or if you are a no-show, you will not be refunded any amount. However, you will be able to retain the full year ACL membership (if it was paid as part of the registration) and have virtual access.\n- Exceptions are made for cancellations due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference. In these cases, the full amount paid will be refunded (minus a processing fee up to $50), regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office. In such cases, supporting documentation must be submitted.\n  \nFor more information, participants can contact Yes Events via email at ACLinfo@yesevents.com or call their toll-free number at 800-937-872."}]
