The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case. This route is also available to prospective workshop authors whose submission sites have not opened yet. Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.

The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case. This route is also available to prospective workshop authors whose submission sites have not opened yet. Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.  We are truly sorry that the current visa processing times for Canada are what they are, and that all we can do is help the participants start the applications as early as possible. We hope that the future conferences will not have similar issues.\n\nACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>Invitation Letter>>content>>You can apply for an invitation letter for obtaining a VISA for ACL 2023 in this form if you have submitted a paper to the main conference ACL 2023 as an author (including co-authors) and your Softconf ID is associated with the submission.\n\nQuestion:Can the conference provide visa letter for attendees?\nAnswer:", "gt": "You can apply for an invitation letter for obtaining a VISA for ACL 2023 in this form if you have submitted a paper to the main conference ACL 2023 as an author (including co-authors) and your Softconf ID is associated with the submission.", "response": "Yes, the conference can provide a visa letter for attendees who have submitted a paper to the main conference ACL 2023 as an author (including co-authors) and have their Softconf ID associated with the submission."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "What is ACL student research workshop?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Student Research Workshop>>content>>Grants>>We expect to have grants to offset some portion of students’ travel, conference registration, and accommodation expenses.

Consider the following questions when deciding where to submit: (1) Does the paper include experiments only on proprietary data? If so, the Industry Track might be a better fit. (2) Is the main contribution of the paper related to a deployment aspect of the application, such as considerations of speed, robustness, usability, or some problem that was discovered during deployment that your results begin to address but more research effort would be required to solve more comprehensively? If so, the Industry Track might be a better fit. (3) Does the paper report new state-of-the-art on a task that is likely to be feasible and interesting outside of your specific setting? If so, the NLP Applications Track might be a better fit. (4) Is your system evaluated only on usability subjects? If so, the NLP Applications Track might be a better fit.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Industry Track>>content>>Paper submission>>Final Version>>Accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 7 pages; ethical considerations, acknowledgements and references do not count against this limit) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Previous presentations of the work (e.g., preprints on arXiv.org) should be indicated in a footnote that should be excluded from the review submission, but included in the final version of papers appearing in the ACL 2023 proceedings.\n\nThe final version should remove anonymization in text, citation, and figures. For example, the final version may include the name of the authors’ institutions, trade names, and screenshots of identifiable products.\n\nIn addition to the final version of the paper, authors of all papers accepted to the Industry Track will be given an option to submit a presentation video, slides, and/or a pdf of their poster.\n\nACL2023>>Committees>>COMMITTEES>>Organizing Committee>>content>>Industry Track Chairs>>Industry Track Chairs_2>>department>>Educational Testing Service (USA)\n\nACL2023>>Committees>>COMMITTEES>>Organizing Committee>>content>>Industry Track Chairs>>Industry Track Chairs_1>>contact>>acl-2023-industry-track-pcs@googlegroups.com\n\nQuestion:What is the main focus of the Industry Track of ACL 2023?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The Industry Track focuses on papers that advance the understanding of, and demonstrate the effective handling of, practical issues related to the deployment of language processing technologies in non-trivial real-world systems.", "response": "The main focus of the Industry Track of ACL 2023 is on real-world implementations of natural language processing systems, the development of such systems, and providing insights based on real-world datasets with obvious industry impact."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "Can students also submit papers to industry track?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Industry Track>>content>>Frequently Asked Questions>>Frequently Asked Questions_3>>question>>Can students also submit papers to industry track?": 0, "ACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Industry Track>>content>>Frequently Asked Questions>>Frequently Asked Questions_3>>answer>>Yes!

We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.", "response": "The policy for professional conduct or behavior for attendees is that harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions.

The policy aims to provide a harassment-free experience for all members and participants, and it prohibits harassment based on various factors such as race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case.

Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.

We will check for the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.\n\nThe participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.\n\nYou CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper. The submission website will have separate tracks for pre-submission mentorship and the final paper submission.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>content>>Submission Procedure>>Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program must be full-time students and should submit the completed application form where we ask a few questions and a one-page CV (resume). Students should make travel arrangements and accommodations independent of the results of the application.\n\nVolunteer Registration Application ACL Toronto 23\n\nPlease DO NOT REGISTER for the ACL 2023 Conference until someone has reached out to you or you have received a Congratulatory email confirming your Volunteer Service Acceptance. Once you have received this Acceptance notification you will receive a special link to register in which your registration fees are waived. Additionally, a separate email containing a Volunteer Registration form will be sent to you, in which you can list what volunteer preference task you would like based on your skillset (i.e. registration, volunteer coordinator, poster session liaison etc.). This form must be completed FIRST in order to receive the ACL Conference 2023 LINK to have registration fees waived. If for any reason you are not accepted, the Registrar will work with you to secure early registration fee rates. In the case that a student requires reimbursement after the conference for LATE volunteer registration, the student must provide receipt of paid registration fees from debit or bank account (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Assistant Director of Events, Megs Haddad (acl.megshaddad@gmail.com).\n\nStudents are required to fill out the Volunteer Reimbursement Form that will be available once selected. In this form, please attach proof of all receipts to be refunded. Preferred refund method for in person conference attendance is Cash at the event (if the form is complete and all receipts are turned in). If this is not possible, a valid mailing address is required to receive a reimbursement check, a valid email address required for PayPal payments, or complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in the event that check reimbursement is not possible).\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Student Research Workshop>>content>>Important Dates>>list>>list_4>>event>>Review deadline \n\nACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Student Research Workshop>>content>>Submission Requirements>>topics>>topics_3>>Discourse and Pragmatics\n\nQuestion:Can a student submit a paper to SRW without participating in the pre-submission mentorship program?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes, a student can submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if they did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring.", "response": "Yes, a student can submit a paper to SRW without participating in the pre-submission mentorship program."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "Will the ACL 2023 conference be held in person?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_8>>title>>ACL 2023 Blog": 0, "ACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Student Research Workshop>>content>>Important Dates>>list>>list_7>>event>>ACL 2023 conference dates ": 0, "ACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Main Conference>>content>>introduction>>The 2nd Call: December 20, 2022\n\nACL 2023 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

As soon as you get an assignment, skim the paper to check whether this is something that you are qualified to review. The assignments are made based on a semi-automatic process, and, even with careful checks by the area chair / action editor, you may feel like you are not qualified to review a given submission.  Yet, even in the best-case scenario the matches will not always be perfect. For very novel work or atypical papers, it is inherently difficult to find available qualified reviewers. The possibility of a close match also depends on the set of people in the reviewing pool: a submission in a large and popular subfield is more likely to find the right reviewers. And even large subfields may experience a lack of well-matching reviewers when they are still actively growing. Moreover, sometimes a less obvious match may also be a conscious decision on the part of the chair/editor, e.g., to collect reviewers from different perspectives when the paper is interdisciplinary, or when it focuses on less popular topics and languages.  So, the bad news is that realistically, you will sometimes be asked to review papers that are a bit outside of your own subfield. That is ok and to be expected, as long as you are sufficiently familiar with the core methodology. If your expertise does not cover certain aspects of the submission, your review should specify that, and most NLP venues let you indicate your confidence score in the review form.  The good news is that the less-than-perfect matches also have upsides: you get to expand your repertoire, the authors get feedback on what needs more clarification/explanation, and NLP in general gets more intellectual exchange between subfields. Do I have a conflict of interest with this submission?  If the venue implements a fully or partially anonymous review process (*ACL conferences do), the second thing to check is whether you know or can guess who the authors are. The problem with implicit social biases is that they are unconscious; we may be 100% sure that we do not think worse of a paper just because it is written by someone from a group minoritized in computing research, and that we are not pre-disposed to like papers coming from famous labs, but we cannot really trust our conscious selves.  Thus, when you get the assignment, do check that anonymity is preserved. If it is not, the paper should be desk-rejected: contact your chair or action editor about this. You can also indicate that the paper should be desk-rejected if it does not follow the style guides or goes over the page limit (which does not include the ethical considerations section).  If anonymity is preserved, but you happen to know who the authors are from personal communication, social media or talks, ask for re-assignment if possible, especially if you have a conflict of interest (because you know the authors personally, have or will work with them etc.). For the papers where it is impossible to maintain anonymity (e.g., because they are too famous, or the authors are easy to guess for anyone who works in the same narrow subfield), the ACL policy is to indicate your awareness of the authors’ identity in the review form (more on that later).

Authors are required to honor the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics. The submissions to ACL and any supplementary materials must not include authors’ names and affiliations, or the acknowledgments section. Self-references that reveal the authors’ identities must be avoided. We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. ACL 2023 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitation section will be automatically rejected without review.", "response": "The submission process for the main conference includes submitting the paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract electronically through the ACL 2023 paper submission site by the abstract submission deadline (January 13).

If the paper has been previously reviewed at other *ACL venues, authors have the option to submit the paper together with the link to the previous Softconf START submission and provide a short explanation of how the paper has been changed in response to the old reviews.
