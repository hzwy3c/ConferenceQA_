We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals for two types of tutorials: ​\n\nCutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list of tutorials in the past 4 years).\nIntroductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques).\n\nIn both cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.\n\nTutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues: ​\n\nEACL 2023 in Dubrovnik, Croatia (hybrid) on May 2-6, 2023.\nACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada (hybrid) on July 9-14, 2023.\nEMNLP 2023 in Singapore on TBD, 2023.": 0.07854431867599487}, "What are some of Geoffrey Hinton's professional recognitions?": {"ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_218>>authors>>authors_1>>Pengcheng He": 0.21278071403503418, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_384>>authors>>authors_5>>Zhenghong Hao": 0.21545898914337158, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_244>>authors>>authors_7>>Chong-Wah Ngo": 0.21600568294525146, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>System Demonstration>>Papers>>Papers_51>>authors>>authors_6>>Steven C.H.
