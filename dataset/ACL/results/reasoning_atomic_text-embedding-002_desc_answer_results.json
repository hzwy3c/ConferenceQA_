The second type is \"Introductory\" tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community, like linguistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning techniques. The aim of these tutorials is to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are also welcome, as long as they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations."}]
