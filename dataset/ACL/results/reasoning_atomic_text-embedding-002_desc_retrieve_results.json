We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals for two types of tutorials: ​\n\nCutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list of tutorials in the past 4 years).\nIntroductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques).\n\nIn both cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.\n\nTutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues: ​\n\nEACL 2023 in Dubrovnik, Croatia (hybrid) on May 2-6, 2023.\nACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada (hybrid) on July 9-14, 2023.\nEMNLP 2023 in Singapore on TBD, 2023.": 0.0887712836265564, "ACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>EMNLP>>TBA": 0.10348284244537354}, "What are some of Geoffrey Hinton's professional recognitions?": {"ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_395>>authors>>authors_5>>Dan Goldwasser": 0.23050302267074585, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>System Demonstration>>Papers>>Papers_8>>authors>>authors_25>>Linlin Shen": 0.2319720983505249, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>Papers>>Papers_70>>authors>>authors_1>>Dmitriy Bespalov": 0.23228484392166138, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_36>>authors>>authors_1>>Chandra Bhagavatula": 0.23637688159942627, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_264>>authors>>authors_2>>JaeYoung Kim": 0.23757922649383545, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>Papers>>Papers_58>>authors>>authors_4>>Hoang Long Nguyen": 0.23839694261550903, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_431>>authors>>authors_1>>Taku Sakamoto": 0.23938775062561035, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Short Papers>>Short Papers_29>>authors>>authors_1>>Sukmin Cho": 0.24003762006759644, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>Papers>>Papers_7>>authors>>authors_6>>Georgios Tsatsaronis": 0.24009984731674194, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>Papers>>Papers_52>>authors>>authors_8>>Yangfeng Ji": 0.24114543199539185, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_223>>authors>>authors_1>>Zhongtao Jiang": 0.2411929965019226, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_363>>authors>>authors_7>>Heyan Huang": 0.24142998456954956, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_52>>authors>>authors_2>>Yuhao Zhang": 0.24173641204833984, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_538>>authors>>authors_1>>Zhenhailong Wang": 0.24211448431015015, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_681>>authors>>authors_6>>Daniel Khashabi": 0.24225687980651855}, "Can a student submit a paper to SRW without participating in the pre-submission mentorship program?": {"ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Short Papers>>Short Papers_152>>authors>>authors_2>>Rui Zhang": 0.21326404809951782, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Findings>>Papers>>Short Papers>>Short Papers_158>>title>>Not Enough Data to Pre-train Your Language Model?
