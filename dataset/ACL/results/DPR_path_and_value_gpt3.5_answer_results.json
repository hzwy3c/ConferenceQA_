The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible.

We hope that the future conferences will not have similar issues.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Travel and Accommodation Subsidies>>We are also providing travel and accommodation subsidies. Priority will be given to authors, first-time attendees and folks from underrepresented communities with financial hurdles.\n\nIf you would like to attend the in-person meeting please keep in mind that if your waiver application is accepted, We are only able to pay in advance for some rooms at the conference hotel (the price needs to be included in the amount of money that you are requesting). Other accommodations and travel expenses (e.g., flight tickets) can only be reimbursed after the conference.\n\nThe number of accepted applicants and the amount of money subsidized will vary depending on the number of applicants and the funding availability.\n\nPlease answer questions regarding whether you have previously attended any *CL conferences (NAACL, EACL, AACL, ACL, EMNLP and COLING) accurately as we would like to give all first-time attendees a chance.\n\nACL2023>>Registration>>Discounted Virtual Registration>>content>> Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration is intended to make ACL events accessible to researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate. The application form for discounted and free virtual registration will be available on May 30th. Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances. Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and higher income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including from these regions) are already substantially discounted.\n\nGiven the large real costs of all conference paper presentations (whether virtual or in-person), all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered at a minimum at the full conference virtual regular rate of $300, or at the higher appropriate in-person rates if attending in person. If this is prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.\n\nACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>Cancellation Policy>>content>>Cancellation of registration one month or more prior to the conference (June 09, 2023, or before), will be refunded the full amount paid. (Minus up to $50 processing fee)\n\nCancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (June 16, 2023) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200.\n\nCancellations 2 weeks prior to start of Conference (June 23, 2023), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have access virtually.\n\nExceptions: Cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference will be refunded the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee) regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office and must submit documentation supporting the above cancelation exceptions.\n\nFor questions about your registration and/or payment, please contact:\n\nYes Events\nACLinfo@yesevents.com\nToll Free: 800-937-872\n\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>content>>Selection Criteria>>Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program will be evaluated based on the material submitted in the application package (see below for the submission requirements).

Their results suggest that about 50% of the accepted NeurIPS papers would have been rejected, had they simply been assigned to different reviewers.

You do need to first at least skim the paper and understand the overall type of contribution and the framework in which the authors are working. If you do not do that, you are likely to start critiquing the paper from the perspective of a “prototypical” NLP paper in your area (e.g., an experimental paper proposing a SOTA system for English). That mental model might bias you against other types of contributions (e.g., resource papers, model or linguistic analysis, data processing/annotation strategies, reproduction studies, surveys, position pieces, negative results). Any study should be judged for what it is, and not for what you think it should be.  For experimental papers, a useful trick is to avoid looking at the results when first skimming the paper. When you start actually reading, carefully read the introduction and the methodology sections. After that, pause and ask yourself: is it clear what the research question is and what was done? Do you believe this would answer that question? Do you want to know the answer? Will the answer advance the field? Only then you should look at the results. This way you will be better able to focus on the knowledge gained in the paper: the result may be negative, but if you believe that the experiments are sound and the question worth asking, something that could save time to many others - this is also a valid contribution, as per the ACL call for papers.  Note whether the paper is long or short, and adjust your expectations accordingly. Long papers are supposed to describe completed work, with thorough evaluation and analysis. A short paper may present proof of concept, an interesting finding, a convincing point, but it is not expected to have extensive evaluation and analysis: only the minimal (but sufficiently convincing) evidence for the claim.  While you read, you may want to look up some references or concurrent work. This should be done cautiously: many papers have non-anonymous preprints, and you may accidentally discover the identity of authors, which would open you up to social biases.

If you do not do that, you are likely to start critiquing the paper from the perspective of a “prototypical” NLP paper in your area (e.g., an experimental paper proposing a SOTA system for English). That mental model might bias you against other types of contributions (e.g., resource papers, model or linguistic analysis, data processing/annotation strategies, reproduction studies, surveys, position pieces, negative results). Any study should be judged for what it is, and not for what you think it should be.  For experimental papers, a useful trick is to avoid looking at the results when first skimming the paper. When you start actually reading, carefully read the introduction and the methodology sections. After that, pause and ask yourself: is it clear what the research question is and what was done? Do you believe this would answer that question? Do you want to know the answer? Will the answer advance the field? Only then you should look at the results. This way you will be better able to focus on the knowledge gained in the paper: the result may be negative, but if you believe that the experiments are sound and the question worth asking, something that could save time to many others - this is also a valid contribution, as per the ACL call for papers.  Note whether the paper is long or short, and adjust your expectations accordingly. Long papers are supposed to describe completed work, with thorough evaluation and analysis. A short paper may present proof of concept, an interesting finding, a convincing point, but it is not expected to have extensive evaluation and analysis: only the minimal (but sufficiently convincing) evidence for the claim.  While you read, you may want to look up some references or concurrent work. This should be done cautiously: many papers have non-anonymous preprints, and you may accidentally discover the identity of authors, which would open you up to social biases. \n\nQuestion:Is the submission of research paper double blind?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes. The submissions to ACL and any supplementary materials must not include authors’ names and affiliations, or the acknowledgments section. Self-references that reveal the authors’ identities must be avoided. For example, instead of “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” or even “We previously showed (Anonymous, 1991)… “ please use “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”.\nThe submissions should avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Please avoid any links to storage services like Dropbox (which may track the reviewers downloading the resources). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.", "response": "Yes, the submission of research papers for ACL2023 is double blind."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "How can I contact the ACL2023 Workshop Chairs?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_734>>title>>Can NLI Provide Proper Indirect Supervision for Low-resource Biomedical Relation Extraction?": 0.14315521717071533, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Short Papers>>Short Papers_5>>title>>Is Anisotropy Truly Harmful?

These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.\n\nHarassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.", "response": "I don't know the answer to that question based on the given context."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What requests are needed for visa letter?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_5>>content>>As you know, ACL 2023 will be held in Toronto, Canada, July 9-14 2023.

The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin.

We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time.

The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student’s work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.\n\nStudents wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft by March 10, 2023.\n\nNote that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check for the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.\n\nThe participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.\n\nYou CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper.

Publishing a paper in an ACL SRW workshop can be really helpful for improving students’ publication record.\nExplorative Studies: We encourage the submission of studies with positive and negative results providing insights on why and in which scenarios a particular method succeeds and fails.\n\nAll accepted papers and thesis proposals will be presented either as oral presentations or during poster sessions, which will give students an opportunity to interact with and to present their work to a large and diverse audience, including top researchers in the field and assigned mentors.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>content>>Selection Criteria>>Applicants for the Student Volunteer Program will be evaluated based on the material submitted in the application package (see below for the submission requirements).

The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case. This route is also available to prospective workshop authors whose submission sites have not opened yet. Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.

The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case. This route is also available to prospective workshop authors whose submission sites have not opened yet. Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.

We solicit proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines such as linguistics, speech, information retrieval, and multimodal processing.\n\nWorkshops will be held at one of the following conference venues:\n\nEACL 2023 (The 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics) will be a hybrid conference, and physically held in Dubrovnik, Croatia from May 2-6, 2023.\nACL 2023 (The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics) will be a hybrid conference, and physically held in Toronto, Canada from July 9-14, 2023.\nEMNLP 2023 (The 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing) TBA\n\nThe workshop co-chairs will work together to assign workshops to the three conferences. They will take into account location preferences and technical constraints provided by the workshop proposers.\n\nACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_6>>content>>content_2>>content>>Each track at ACL 2023 has an associated set of keywords describing its potential sub-areas. These lists are not intended to be exclusive; they only describe the biggest expected sub-areas, and hopefully provide a better idea of the kind of work that the track is inviting. In our case they were provided by the SACs of all tracks independently, and future conferences may wish to take a more top-down approach to editing this list.\n\nACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_6>>content>>content_3>>stages>>stages_1>>sub-area keywords collection: the senior area chairs of all tracks consider the potential keywords for their tracks. We ask them to come up with no more than 10-15 keywords to describe the sub-areas in which they expect the most submissions in the coming conference, based on their knowledge of the area. While each track can have a lot more potential sub-areas, the goal is only to catch the biggest/most frequent potential sub-areas, which would help to characterize the bulk of the submissions. The more niche submissions would be handled differently.\n\nQuestion:What are the side events organized alongside the main conference?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Events organized alongside the main conference are Keynotes and Social Programs", "response": "The given context does not provide information about the specific side events organized alongside the main conference."}, {"type": "reasoning_complex", "query": "Are there any workshops related to representation learning for NLP?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Workshops>>Diversity and Inclusion>>The proposals should describe the ways in which the workshop will support diversity in NLP.

When you accept an invitation to review for ACL conferences or ARR, please make sure that your Semantic Scholar profile is accurate and up-to-date, and provided in the relevant forms. For ACL 2023, the semantic scholar field is set through softconf global profile (log in to the ACL site, in the top left corner find User > Account Information > Go to the global profile). This information is used in the automatic paper-reviewer matching process, so the more accurate it is - the more likely you are to get papers in your area at *ACL venues.

You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.\n\nACL2023>>FAQ>>Frequently Asked Questions>>Frequently Asked Questions_2>>QA>>QA_7>>A>>Due to a limitation of SoftConf, it’s easiest to just upload a PDF that just says “no previous submissions”.

Please carefully follow the directions, check the FAQs, and ask your colleagues for advice. We will update this FAQ as we get new questions about submission.
