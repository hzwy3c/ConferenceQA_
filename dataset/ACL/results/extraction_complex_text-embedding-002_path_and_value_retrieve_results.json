While the current systems perform much better and fail more gracefully than their rule-based predecessors, there are growing piles of evidence of other kinds of brittleness, including out-of-domain generalization, adversarial attacks, spurious patterns (both linguistic and social), lack of sensitivity to basic linguistic perturbations such as negation, over-sensitivity to perturbations that should not matter (e.g. order and wording of prompts), etc.\n\nThe theme track invites empirical and theoretical research, as well as position and survey papers reflecting on the ways in which reported performance improvements on NLP benchmarks are meaningful. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\nHow reliably do the leaderboard scores translate to improvements in real-world use of the models?\nHow reliably do the leaderboard scores compare competing models?\nWhile the current NLP systems are not brittle in the same way as their predecessors, they are still brittle in other ways. What tasks can we claim to have “solved”, if any?\nHave performance improvements been accompanied by commensurate growth in the scientific understanding (of language, cognition, or deep learning technology)? In what ways?\nGiven that the authors of engineering papers are incentivized to report only the most successful results, especially for the systems that are also commercial products, what can the NLP venues do to improve reporting?\n\nThe theme track submissions can be either long or short.
