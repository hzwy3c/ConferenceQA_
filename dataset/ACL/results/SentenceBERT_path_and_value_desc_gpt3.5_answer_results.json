For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.\n\nHarassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.", "response": "I don't know the answer to that question."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What requests are needed for visa letter?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_671>>authors>>authors_5>>Jun Xiao": 0.28709834814071655, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_724>>title>>Interpreting Positional Information in Perspective of Word Order": 0.2930152416229248, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_737>>title>>Enhancing Language Representation with Constructional Information for Natural Language Understanding": 0.29561686515808105, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_194>>title>>Do language models have coherent mental models of everyday things?": 0.3002541661262512, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_460>>authors>>authors_2>>Ximing Li": 0.3011631369590759}, "from": "ACL2023/Participants/Participants Information/Invitation Letter/content", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
