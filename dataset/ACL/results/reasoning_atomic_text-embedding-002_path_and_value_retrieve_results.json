We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals for two types of tutorials: ​\n\nCutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list of tutorials in the past 4 years).\nIntroductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques).\n\nIn both cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.\n\nTutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues: ​\n\nEACL 2023 in Dubrovnik, Croatia (hybrid) on May 2-6, 2023.\nACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada (hybrid) on July 9-14, 2023.\nEMNLP 2023 in Singapore on TBD, 2023.": 0.08031511306762695, "ACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>Submission Details>>list>>list_16>>A note specifying which venue(s) (EACL/ACL/EMNLP) would be acceptable and/or preferable.

After five years as a faculty member at Carnegie-Mellon he became a fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and moved to the University of Toronto where he is now an emeritus professor. He is also the Chief Scientific Adviser at the Vector Institute.\n\nHe was one of the researchers who introduced the backpropagation algorithm and the first to use backpropagation for learning word embeddings. His other contributions to neural network research include Boltzmann machines, distributed representations, time-delay neural nets, mixtures of experts, variational learning and deep learning. His research group in Toronto made major breakthroughs in deep learning that revolutionized speech recognition and object classification.\n\nHe is a fellow of the UK Royal Society and a foreign member of the US National Academy of Engineering, the US National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His awards include the David E. Rumelhart prize, the IJCAI award for research excellence, the Killam prize for Engineering, the Royal Society Royal Medal, the NSERC Herzberg Gold Medal, the IEEE James Clerk Maxwell Gold medal, the NEC C&C award, the BBVA award, the Honda Prize and the Turing Award.": 0.10946798324584961, "ACL2023>>Program>>EVENTS>>Keynotes>>content>>speakers>>speakers_1>>name>>Geoffrey Hinton": 0.15541863441467285, "ACL2023>>Program>>PROGRAMS>>Conference Overview>>content>>content_2>>schedule>>schedule_3>>Session>>Keynote: Geoffrey Hinton": 0.16180604696273804, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_546>>authors>>authors_5>>Geoffrey Cideron": 0.21068060398101807, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Industry Track>>Papers>>Papers_17>>authors>>authors_2>>Guy Horowitz": 0.21474742889404297, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Short Papers>>Short Papers_139>>authors>>authors_3>>Graeme Hirst": 0.21633362770080566, "ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Long Papers>>Long Papers_546>>authors>>authors_9>>Leonard Hussenot": 0.2191275954246521}, "Can a student submit a paper to SRW without participating in the pre-submission mentorship program?": {"ACL2023>>Calls>>CALL FOR PAPERS>>Student Research Workshop>>content>>Pre-Submission Mentorship Program>>content>>The SRW offers students the opportunity to receive feedback prior to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student’s work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged. The pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous.\n\nStudents wishing to participate in the pre-submission mentorship must submit their paper draft by March 10, 2023.\n\nNote that even though the mentoring is not done anonymously, the paper needs to be anonymized. We will check for the formality of the paper including formatting before we match it with mentors.\n\nThe participants will be assigned a mentor who will review and will provide feedback within four weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the form of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing, which should ideally be incorporated before the actual submission deadline.\n\nYou CAN submit a paper at the SRW submission deadline even if you did not participate in the pre-submission mentoring. If you did submit a draft for pre-submission mentoring, you will need to make a new submission for the final version of the paper.
