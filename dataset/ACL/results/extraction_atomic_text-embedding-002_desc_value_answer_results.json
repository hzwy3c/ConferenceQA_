They can set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. They must follow the given timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies for each conference, unless an agreement for deviation is reached with the relevant Workshop Chairs."}, {"query": "What is Computational Linguistics?", "output": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. The work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, and more."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of regisration?", "output": "The cancellation policy for the registration is as follows:\n\n- If you cancel one month or more prior to the conference (by June 09, 2023), you will be refunded the full amount paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee.\n- If you cancel up to three weeks prior to the conference (by June 16, 2023), you will be refunded the ACL membership fee (if it was paid as part of the registration) and any amounts over the first $200.\n- If you cancel 2 weeks prior to the start of the Conference (June 23, 2023) or do not show up, no amounts will be refunded. But you will retain the current full year ACL membership (if it was paid as part of the registration) and have virtual access.\n- Exceptions are made for cancellations due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness preventing travel to the conference.
