The track provides an opportunity to highlight key insights and new research challenges from real world implementations. It invites submissions describing innovations and implementations in all areas of speech and natural language processing technologies and systems relevant to real-world applications."}, {"query": "What is Computational Linguistics?", "output": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. The work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, among others."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of regisration?", "output": "The cancellation policy of registration for ACL2023 is as follows: \n\n- If you cancel your registration one month or more prior to the conference, which is by June 9, 2023, you will be refunded the full amount you paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee.\n\n- Cancellations made up to three weeks prior to the conference, meaning by June 16, 2023, will result in a refund of the ACL membership (if it was paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid beyond the first $200.\n\n- If you cancel two weeks prior to the start of the conference, which is by June 23, 2023, or do not show up, you will not be refunded any amount. However, you can retain the current full year ACL membership (if it was paid as part of the registration) and have virtual access to the event.\n\nExceptions to these rules are for cancellations due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or a serious illness that prevents travel to the conference. In these cases, you will be refunded the full amount paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee, regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office. You must, however, submit documentation proving these circumstances."}]
