Cutting-edge tutorials cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any related tutorial. Introductory tutorials provide introductions to related fields potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community. The aim of both types of tutorials is to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are also welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations."}]
