The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case.

If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history.

Besides serving as a token of community recognition, and they come with a special award: a fee waiver for any *ACL virtual conference, to be used within a year of the award. Since most academic institutions cover attendance for the conferences where their affiliated authors have accepted papers—but not other conferences—-we hope that this will allow the awardees to attend more conferences than they would otherwise, and the benefit of the award will thus be received by them rather than by their host institutions.\n\nThe reviewers are nominated for awards by their area chairs, whom we asked to recognize the reviewers providing extra helpful reviews or high-quality emergency reviews, “champion’’ reviewers, and reviewers who were particularly active in the discussion phase, and demonstrated exceptional open-mindedness or expertise. We also asked the Senior Area chairs to nominate exceptional area chairs, and finally we as PCs also nominated the SACs of the track that was the most on-time with its tasks, provided the most helpful feedback, and followed our instructions the most closely. In total, we have 67 awards.\n\nHere’s a few of our favorite reviewer nomination pitches:\n\nAlthough the paper was neither sound nor exciting, they took the time to write very specific and detailed comments along with constructive feedback and suggestions.\n\nThey wrote good enthusiastic reviews and actively participated in the discussion, acknowledging and taking into account other reviewers, as well as clarifying their own stance.\n\nThis reviewer not only submitted thorough and helpful review, but also followed up on the authors’ response and provided convincing arguments for why the paper should be accepted.\n\nThey responded very promptly, humbly, and with an open mind to my request to fix some review policy issues before the author response. As a result, they revised their review to be very balanced while keeping a friendly and encouraging tone.\n\nThis reviewer did a thorough emergency review in one day, she is a hero :)\n\nThey volunteered to do an emergency review and wrote detailed reviews for both papers they reviewed in my batch. Additionally, they proactively started discussing with the other reviewers after the rebuttal, pushing back on some of the other reviewers’ criticism that was unjustified also in my opinion.\n\nAnd AC nomination pitches:\n\n… had read at least two papers herself to make a more informed decision. In one case this led to noticing reviewers’ misunderstanding/mistakes and saved the submission.\n\nThorough summaries, engagement in the reviewers’ discussions, clear stands on the papers.\n\nThis area chair proactively completed all assigned duties well in time, moderated discussions promptly, and even maintained a log of interactions with late reviewers to chase them for completing their tasks in time. He also declared potential COIs upfront, so as to avoid later conflicts.\n\nOn behalf of ourselves and the authors - thanks for your help!": 0.1305888295173645, "ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_1>>content>>One of frequent complaints at the past conferences was that solid work was rejected for not being “surprising”/”novel”/”too niche”/etc, based on reviewers’ rather subjective views. This is difficult to combat because in a system in which the reviewer provides a single recommendation score, such subjective preferences are inevitably tangled with judgements on the other aspects of the paper.\nACL’23 is experimenting with an alternative paper scoring system. Instead of the traditional “overall recommendation” score, we explicitly ask reviewers about whether the submission presents sound research, and how exciting they personally find it. The former criterion can be estimated more objectively, as long as the reviewers have sufficient expertise. The latter is inevitably more subjective, and may reflect the reviewers’ own research agenda, perception of novelty, potential utility to themselves or their sub-community, or other such factors that are hard to disentangle – but reviewers do wish to communicate. You can see the full form and its scoring rubrics here.\nThe pros of this separation of “soundness” and “excitement” are as follows:\nthe reviewers should be able to provide more accurate estimates of soundness by disentangling their own research interests and preferences;\nthe reviewer job is easier (especially the new reviewers, who may not have a very clear idea of what is expected of an *ACL paper, could find it hard to make that call);\nthe authors receive more actionable information from the review: e.g. instead of overall score “3” you get “2” in soundness and “4” in excitement, you know that you need to revise and resubmit, and if it’s the other way round - then you just were not lucky to find a reviewer who shares your interests;\nthe authors can focus their response on soundness (where reasonable argumentation is possible) rather than excitement (where it may not be very productive to try to convince the reviewers that their research tastes are wrong);\nthe chairs have more information for assembling the program and planning the conference sessions;\nthrough correlating these scores with paper types,we can learn the implicit and explicit norms and attitudes in the field to improve the peer review process.\nOne complaint we’ve seen on social media is that the old system of an overall score offered a better clue as to whether a paper is going to get in and are disappointed because they don’t see such a straightforward mapping here. However, even the regular “overall recommendation” could only be trusted for the relatively few papers with all top scores or all low scores. In the middle, much is at the discretion of the chairs, who rely on the full review text, consider reviewer confidence and expertise, etc. It’s the same in our case, except that the chairs get a bit more information to go on. Our hope is that this information will help chairs come to better conclusions.\nLet’s dig into this a bit more:\nneither score is functionally equivalent to the traditional “overall recommendation” score (unfortunately, softconf shows statistics for only one of them in the review reports, but that does not mean it’s the same as the old score);\nthe “soundness” score is more important: non-scientifically-sound papers should not be published anywhere. This follows from our CFP and common sense. (Some reviewers saw early review reports that highlighted excitement scores but not soundness thought that meant excitement is more central to accept/reject decisions; this is certainly not the case. This was just a symptom of Softconf catching up to the new review criteria, and it is now fixed.)\nthe “excitement” score helps decision makers understand reviews better. In conferences using a single recommendation score, a paper with three middling scores is difficult to make a decision about. In ACL’23, if such a paper scores high on soundness but low on excitement, it’s clear that it should be accepted somewhere. If the soundness scores are all low but some reviewers are excited, this probably means the paper is a great idea but needs more development. That said, as in any conference, the chairs have discretion based on their high-level knowledge of the field and editorial priorities. They may also downweigh or discard reviews that have serious issues, low reviewer confidence, etc.\nThe primary purpose of the author response period is always to clarify any misunderstandings and to improve the accuracy of the reviews. It is the same in our case. We recommend to focus on soundness, because it is realistically the score that is more likely to be improved through clarifications, than “this is not surprising” kind of comments. That said, the authors are of course welcome to address any reviewer points that they wish. An additional quality assurance step that is new at ACL’23 is that the authors can flag serious issues in reviews by their type for the chairs.\nWe recognize that this is new and different. It’s an experiment. Thus, to help everyone better understand what’s going on, we are sharing the distribution of the “excitement” and “soundness” scores below. As you can see, most submissions are in the middle of the distribution, just like with the regular single-score process.\nOverall distribution for 'soundness' and 'excitement' scores at ACL 2023 (pre-rebuttal)": 0.13149917125701904, "ACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Selection Criteria>>Applications will be evaluated based on the submitted materials and provided justifications.

Besides serving as a token of community recognition, and they come with a special award: a fee waiver for any *ACL virtual conference, to be used within a year of the award. Since most academic institutions cover attendance for the conferences where their affiliated authors have accepted papers—but not other conferences—-we hope that this will allow the awardees to attend more conferences than they would otherwise, and the benefit of the award will thus be received by them rather than by their host institutions.\n\nThe reviewers are nominated for awards by their area chairs, whom we asked to recognize the reviewers providing extra helpful reviews or high-quality emergency reviews, “champion’’ reviewers, and reviewers who were particularly active in the discussion phase, and demonstrated exceptional open-mindedness or expertise. We also asked the Senior Area chairs to nominate exceptional area chairs, and finally we as PCs also nominated the SACs of the track that was the most on-time with its tasks, provided the most helpful feedback, and followed our instructions the most closely. In total, we have 67 awards.\n\nHere’s a few of our favorite reviewer nomination pitches:\n\nAlthough the paper was neither sound nor exciting, they took the time to write very specific and detailed comments along with constructive feedback and suggestions.\n\nThey wrote good enthusiastic reviews and actively participated in the discussion, acknowledging and taking into account other reviewers, as well as clarifying their own stance.\n\nThis reviewer not only submitted thorough and helpful review, but also followed up on the authors’ response and provided convincing arguments for why the paper should be accepted.\n\nThey responded very promptly, humbly, and with an open mind to my request to fix some review policy issues before the author response. As a result, they revised their review to be very balanced while keeping a friendly and encouraging tone.\n\nThis reviewer did a thorough emergency review in one day, she is a hero :)\n\nThey volunteered to do an emergency review and wrote detailed reviews for both papers they reviewed in my batch. Additionally, they proactively started discussing with the other reviewers after the rebuttal, pushing back on some of the other reviewers’ criticism that was unjustified also in my opinion.\n\nAnd AC nomination pitches:\n\n… had read at least two papers herself to make a more informed decision. In one case this led to noticing reviewers’ misunderstanding/mistakes and saved the submission.\n\nThorough summaries, engagement in the reviewers’ discussions, clear stands on the papers.\n\nThis area chair proactively completed all assigned duties well in time, moderated discussions promptly, and even maintained a log of interactions with late reviewers to chase them for completing their tasks in time. He also declared potential COIs upfront, so as to avoid later conflicts.\n\nOn behalf of ourselves and the authors - thanks for your help!\n\nACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_1>>content>>One of frequent complaints at the past conferences was that solid work was rejected for not being “surprising”/”novel”/”too niche”/etc, based on reviewers’ rather subjective views. This is difficult to combat because in a system in which the reviewer provides a single recommendation score, such subjective preferences are inevitably tangled with judgements on the other aspects of the paper.\nACL’23 is experimenting with an alternative paper scoring system. Instead of the traditional “overall recommendation” score, we explicitly ask reviewers about whether the submission presents sound research, and how exciting they personally find it. The former criterion can be estimated more objectively, as long as the reviewers have sufficient expertise. The latter is inevitably more subjective, and may reflect the reviewers’ own research agenda, perception of novelty, potential utility to themselves or their sub-community, or other such factors that are hard to disentangle – but reviewers do wish to communicate.

The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review.

The citizens of most countries need either an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to visit Canada. You can find out if you need a visa to travel to Canada at this page.  The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review.

To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible. Normally letters of invitation to the authors are issued after acceptance notifications, but in this case we have to start issuing them on the basis of papers being under review. We will soon reach out to all authors, reviewers and organizers of ACL with instructions on how to apply for the invitation letter if they need one.  For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case. This route is also available to prospective workshop authors whose submission sites have not opened yet. Please reach out at acl2023_visa_help@googlegroups.com, communicating the following: name, institution, address, role in conference (author/reviewer/workshop organizer/invited speakers/other participants), additional reasons/justifications for attending. Our dedicated visa assistance team will be in touch to help out with the visa letter request.  If you have an active submission under review or are a reviewer, area or senior chair for ACL, do not reach out by email. Please wait for instructions that will come through softconf email by February 1st.  When submitting the visa application, you will need to provide your travel, education, and employment history. The application form asks for the contact details of the local representative for ACL. That role will be performed by Graeme Hirst (University of Toronto), and the contact details to copy into the application form will be provided in the invitation letter.  We are truly sorry that the current visa processing times for Canada are what they are, and that all we can do is help the participants start the applications as early as possible.

The application form for discounted and free virtual registration will be available on May 30th. Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances. Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and higher income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including from these regions) are already substantially discounted.\n\nGiven the large real costs of all conference paper presentations (whether virtual or in-person), all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered at a minimum at the full conference virtual regular rate of $300, or at the higher appropriate in-person rates if attending in person. If this is prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Registration and ACL Membership Subsidies>>This is for getting a waiver for ACL registration. You can also request ACL membership if applicable. You will be asked to justify your application. For instance, you can say:\n\n“I have an accepted paper at the main conference. I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver because my fees are not funded by my organization/institution.”\n“I have an accepted paper at an ACL Workshop/ the SRW/ SemEval shared task, I live in a developing country [name the country] and I/my institution cannot afford the registration fees.”\n\nNote that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, you SHOULD NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&I subsidy application. That way, you would not have to ask for a reimbursement, since you would not be charged in the first place.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we will take your justification into account when processing your application.\n\nACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_5>>content>>As you know, ACL 2023 will be held in Toronto, Canada, July 9-14 2023.
