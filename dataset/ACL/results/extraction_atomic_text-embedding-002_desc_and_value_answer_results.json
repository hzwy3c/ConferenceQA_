They also have to commit to all deadlines, as failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from proceedings and indexes. They cannot accept submissions for publication that have been published elsewhere, though they can set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Timelines for submission, review, and preparation of copies will be different for each conference, and the organizers should not deviate from the suggested timeline unless absolutely necessary and agreed upon by the Workshop Chairs."}, {"query": "What is Computational Linguistics?", "output": "Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be “knowledge-based” (“hand-crafted”) or “data-driven” (“statistical” or “empirical”). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. The work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, among others."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of regisration?", "output": "The cancellation policy of registration is as follows:\n\nIf you cancel your registration one month or more prior to the conference (June 09, 2023, or before), you will be refunded the full amount paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee. \n\nIf you cancel up to three weeks prior to the conference (June 16, 2023), you will be refunded the ACL membership (if it was paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200. \n\nCancellations 2 weeks prior to the start of the conference (June 23, 2023), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount.
