These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.\n\nHarassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.", "response": "The ACL Code of Conduct outlines the policy for professional conduct or behavior for attendees at ACL events. It emphasizes the importance of open exchange of ideas, respectful scientific debate, and fostering an inclusive and positive environment. Harassment and hostile behavior are not tolerated, and anyone who experiences such behavior can contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. The community as a whole is responsible for promoting an inclusive and positive environment. Workshop organizers are also responsible for publicizing and enforcing the anti-harassment policy at their events."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What requests are needed for visa letter?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>Invitation Letter>>content>>You can apply for an invitation letter for obtaining a VISA for ACL 2023 in this form if you have submitted a paper to the main conference ACL 2023 as an author (including co-authors) and your Softconf ID is associated with the submission.": 0.17335844039916992, "ACL2023>>Home>>News>>News_9>>title>>Application form for an invitation letter is posted under the Participants Info.": 0.18754500150680542, "ACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>Invitation Letter>>title>>Invitation Letter": 0.19687604904174805, "ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_5>>content>>As you know, ACL 2023 will be held in Toronto, Canada, July 9-14 2023.

The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries.

For the people who would like to attend ACL, but are not authors, reviewers or organizers: the invitations to faculty and PhD students of relevant NLP/CL/CS programs, or industry participants from companies doing specialized work in NLP/CL (including all ACL sponsors) will be considered case-by-case.

Her contributions include proposing that children's learning is guided by an innate theory of mind, which allows them to make inferences about the mental states of others. She has also explored the idea that children's learning is more like scientific discovery than rote memorization. In the field of NLP, her work may not have a direct impact, but her ideas about learning and cognition could inspire new approaches to machine learning and AI.\n\nAs for the paper \"Rethinking Annotation: Can Language Learners Contribute?\" it is about exploring the potential of language learners to contribute to annotation efforts in NLP. The authors argue that language learners, who are often multilingual and have a good understanding of the nuances of language, could provide valuable annotations that are currently being done by professionals.
