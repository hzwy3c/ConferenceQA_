The association was founded in 1962 and became the ACL in 1968. The activities of the ACL include the holding of an annual meeting each summer and the sponsoring of the journal Computational Linguistics, published by MIT Press."}, {"query": "Who are the intended recipients for Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration?", "output": "The intended recipients for Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration are researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate in the ACL events. The financial aid will be prioritized for those in greatest financial need and it is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and higher income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Criteria for selection for financial aid will include country of residence, employment position, monthly income range, available financial support from your employer/university, and special circumstances."}, {"query": "What does the Full Conference In-person Registration Fee Include?", "output": "The Full Conference In-person Registration Fee includes admission to all in-person Meeting sessions and the exhibition as well as the entire virtual program, a conference bag and materials, tea and coffee breaks throughout the Meeting, admission to the Welcome Reception on Sunday 9th of July at The Westin Harbour Castle, Metropolitan Ballroom including light canapes and a welcome drink, admission to the Social Dinner on Tuesday 11th July at The Steam Whistle Brewer, including buffet dinner, and attendance to all recorded sessions on demand for at least one month following the Meeting."}, {"query": "What are the ethical considerations for paper submissions?", "output": "The ethical considerations for paper submissions include honoring the ethical code set out in the ACL Code of Ethics. Authors are required to include the Responsible NLP Research checklist with their submissions, which provides structured information about the ethics and reproducibility aspects of the study. The checklist should be considered from the early stages of the project and not as an afterthought. If there are concerns about the ethical aspects of a submission, it may be reviewed by the ACL ethics committee. Papers can be rejected on ethical grounds if the authors are judged to have acted counter to the code of ethics, or have inadequately addressed legitimate ethical concerns with their work."}, {"query": "Can I submit the same paper to another conference that is currently under review elsewhere (e.g. at EACL)?", "output": "Yes, you can submit the same paper to another conference like ACL that is currently under review elsewhere (e.g. at EACL) given certain conditions. You must withdraw the paper from the other conference within 24 hours of its acceptance notification. Additionally, you can submit a work under review for EACL 2023 or ICLR 2023 to ACL 2023, but this must be declared at submission time. If the work is accepted, it must be withdrawn from ACL no later than January 31 for EACL 2023 and no later than January 22 for ICLR 2023. Other than these specific situations, no other double submissions are allowed."}, {"query": "What are the guidelines about video submission for the system demonstration?", "output": "The video submission for the system demonstration should be a short, maximum 2 minutes long, video demonstrating the system. This video will be used to evaluate the paper, but it won't be published unless requested. A screencast with audio narration is a recommended choice for demos that can be presented on a screen. If not, a video of a user interacting with the system can be used. The production quality of the video is not of interest, and the videos are encouraged to be simply a screencast of the software that is getting demoed, with zero to minimal editing efforts. It is suggested that the video be published on YouTube or another website and include the link in the paper. If the screencast is not publicly uploaded, it needs to be in MPEG4 format and included as supplementary material with the paper submission via START."}, {"query": "What is the multiple submission policy of the ACL 2023?", "output": "The multiple submission policy of ACL 2023 states that any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission will not be considered. Submitted papers must also not be submitted elsewhere during the ACL 2023 review period. This policy covers all refereed and archival conferences, workshops, and ACL Rolling Reviews. Any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere will also not be considered. If authors are submitting more than one paper to ACL 2023, they must ensure that their submissions do not overlap significantly in content or results. Identical or closely related work submitted to multiple ACL 2023 tracks will be treated as duplicate submissions and rejected. There is an exception for works under review for EACL 2023 or ICLR 2023, which can be submitted but must be declared at submission and withdrawn if accepted to either of the two conferences."}, {"query": "What is the anti-harassment policy at ACL events?", "output": "The anti-harassment policy at ACL events is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all members and participants. Harassment and hostile behavior, including speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation in an event, are unwelcome. This includes harassment based on attributes such as race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Unacceptable behaviors include degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy does not intend to inhibit scientific debate, but promote it by ensuring everyone is welcomed to participate. Those who experience harassment or hostile behavior may contact the Professional Conduct Committee, who will handle the case in strict confidence. Willful misuse of the procedure or vexatious complaints will be subject to sanctions."}, {"query": "What are the possible topics for discussion under the theme track 'Reality Check'?", "output": "The possible topics for discussion under the theme track 'Reality Check' include: \n1. How reliably do the leaderboard scores translate to improvements in real-world use of the models?\n2. How reliably do the leaderboard scores compare competing models?\n3. While the current NLP systems are not brittle in the same way as their predecessors, they are still brittle in other ways. What tasks can we claim to have “solved”, if any?\n4. Have performance improvements been accompanied by commensurate growth in the scientific understanding (of language, cognition, or deep learning technology)? In what ways?\n5. Given that the authors of engineering papers are incentivized to report only the most successful results, especially for the systems that are also commercial products, what can the NLP venues do to improve reporting? \n\nOther areas include (non-)generalizability, (non-)reproducibility, evaluation, methodology, negative results, AI hype & expectations, science-vs-engineering, lessons from other fields and forgotten lessons."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of the conference?", "output": "The cancellation policy for the conference is as follows: \n\n- If the cancellation of registration is one month or more prior to the conference (June 09, 2023, or before), the full amount paid will be refunded but may be subject to a $50 processing fee.\n- Cancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (June 16, 2023) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200.\n- Cancellations 2 weeks prior to the start of Conference (June 23, 2023), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. However, they will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have virtual access.\n- Exceptions to these rules include: Cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference. In these cases, the full amount paid will be refunded (Minus up to $50 processing fee) regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office, provided that documentation supporting the cancellation exceptions is submitted."}]
