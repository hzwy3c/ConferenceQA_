If your original opinion was very positive, in the face of a strongly negative review you may be tempted to “converge to the mean” (or the other way round).

ACL’23 disallows this. In some venues you may report such results, but the submission will still be evaluated for acceptance in its submission version.

Your review will be seen by three different audiences: (a) the authors, (b) the other reviewers and the area chair, and (c) the senior area chairs and the program chairs (this is discussed in more detail below, “writing a strong review”). Not all parts of the form are addressed to all of them. What is this paper about?  The summary of a paper should be just that: a neutral, dispassionate summary of the research question and findings/contributions. We would help the program chairs the most by not tainting these summaries with, e.g., suggestions that the topic is exciting or a waste of time.  Make sure you acknowledge all the contributions that you believe the paper is making: experimental evidence, replication, framing of a new question, artifacts that can be used in future work (models, resources, code), literature review, establishing new cross-disciplinary connections, conceptual developments, theoretical arguments. A paper may make several contributions, and not all of them need to be equally strong. You should state in your own words what you see as contributions of the paper, rather than copy/paste it from the abstract. This helps the authors and the chairs to see that you understood the gist of the paper, and hence the rest of your review should be taken seriously. Reasons to accept  Even if you fundamentally disagree with something in the paper, it is important for the program chairs (and the mental health of the authors) that you accurately state all the best aspects of it. It also helps them to see that you actually understand the work, and hence any criticisms should be taken seriously.  The contributions of the paper are the obvious candidates for the “reasons to accept”. They may come in many different forms and should be recognized, even if they are not the type of contribution that you aim for in your own work. ACL CFP explicitly welcomes the following kinds of contributions: an engineering solution, a literature review, a useful artifact (a model, software, a resource), reproduction of prior results, analysis (of models or data), theory, argumentation/position.  In assessing a contribution, performance improvements or complex math are by themselves neither necessary nor sufficient. It should be clear in what way the study advances the field: what did we learn from it that we did not know before? What can we do that we could not do before? Are the research claims clearly articulated and sufficiently backed up by the appropriate evidence, literature or theory/arguments?  If one of the strengths is the performance of the proposed system, do check that the baseline is sufficiently strong and well-tuned, and that the result is robust (e.g., not just the best of an unknown number of runs with unknown standard deviation between runs). Ideally, the computation budget should be reported. If you cannot find something in the paper, see if the responsible NLP checklist contains any answers or pointers to the paper or supplementary materials.  Apart from the contributions of the paper, its strengths may be in e.g. being clear and well-written, in formulating a timely/important question, in proposing a better framing of a problem, showing previously ignored connections between ideas/fields, a conceptual development, etc. Reasons to reject  Many things could go wrong in a study. Although reviewers often disagree about acceptance recommendations for papers above a certain quality threshold, the NeurIPS experiment showed that low-quality papers are identified quite reliably. There may be claims that are not actually supported by the evidence or by the arguments, but that are presented as conclusions rather than as hypotheses/discussion. The framing may be misleading. There may be obvious methodological flaws (e.g., only the best run results are reported), errors in the proofs, in the implementation, or in the analysis. There may be insufficient detail to understand what was done or how to reproduce the method and the results. There may be a lack of clarity about what the research question is (even if it is “Does system A work better than system B”?), what was done, why, and what was the conclusion. The paper should also make it clear in what way the findings and/or the released artifacts advance the field.  At the same time, there are many complaints about reviews at previous conferences that cite as weaknesses things that are not in fact weaknesses, but rather belong in the “suggestions” box. Once you have the first draft of your review, you will need to revisit it to check for these frequent issues.  Every work has limitations, and ACL 2023 submissions include a mandatory section for discussing that. Please take care to not penalize the authors for seriously thinking through the limitations of their work, in ethical or any other aspect. First, this information is crucial for future work. Second, if we as a community reward focusing only on positive aspects of research, this contributes to the over-hyping problem which damages the credibility of the whole field. Questions for the Author(s)  Do you have major questions for the authors - especially if their answers would be relevant for your recommendation? Please note that the authors will have limited space to answer, and this section should be reserved for the “big” questions - not things like typos or non-critical missing references.  Please use the letter numbering scheme for your questions, e.g.  Question A: Question B: Question C:  Combined with your reviewer number, this will make it easy to refer to your questions in rebuttal and reviewer discussion (e.g. question 2A = question A of reviewer 2). Missing References  Please list any references that should be included in the bibliography or need to be discussed in more depth. If you mentioned missing previous work or lack of baselines, give the full citation. In particular, if you say that the submission lacks novelty, please be sure to include the specific work that you believe to be similar. Typos, Grammar, Style, and Presentation Improvements  While the other fields are written for the chairs, this field is exclusively a message to the authors. This is the place for presentation suggestions, clarifications, pointing out (a reasonable amount of) typos or language errors: the small things that you do not consider “weaknesses” and should not distract the chairs from your overall assessment. Of course, if you find the paper completely illegible or unclear, such issues can escalate to the “weakness” list for the chairs.  Things could be unclear because it is generally not easy to communicate clearly and effectively with a wide audience—especially when you have been working on a project for a long time and it all seems obvious to yourself, but not to others. Reviewers are the beta-readers, who can help the authors to significantly improve their papers. If you see something that they could do to increase the potential impact of their work, it is professional courtesy to let them know. Some examples include figures that are hard to read or interpret, the points that require extra background reading, ambiguity, and non-obvious connections between sections. If you have comments or questions that you would like the authors to respond to (beyond “thanks, we’ll fix this”), please move them to the “questions for the authors” and include them in the letter-numbered questions.  Be careful in suggesting citations of your own papers. When you have truly relevant related work, this is appropriate, but it is also potentially de-anonymizing (especially when the paper in question is not very well-known). One workaround is to suggest several citations, including yours. Reproducibility, Ethics Review, Anonymity Requirement and Overall Recommendation  The most important part of the review is your thorough comments. However, what many people focus on are numbers, particularly the “overall recommendation”. Thus, it would be remiss for our advice to overlook this part of the process.  ACL 2023 is trying something new this year. We are splitting this decision into two parts: how sound the paper is and how exciting you find the paper.  Soundness goes to how well the paper clearly states its claims and backs up them with evidence and argumentation. We want all papers to clear a minimum bar for presenting solid, thorough, technically sound research. We suspect that this will have lower variance than the other key metric, excitement. Please work with your fellow reviewers to come to a consensus: what are the claims of the paper and do you believe them?  Excitement captures the more subjective evaluations of the novelty/significance of the contributions, and their potential interesting-ness to the community. Because not everyone will calibrate their scores the same way (this will depend on the batch of papers you get, your research area, and the direction you think the field should go), make sure that your scores are justified in the text of the review.  The AC should be able to understand your justification of both scores to create a consensus score from all of the reviews. Please try to disentangle these two aspects in your review: e.g. even if you find a paper boring, it could still be sound and thorough.  Reproducibility  As you assess the reproducibility of the paper, think about not just whether the raw information to reproduce the paper are included. Also think about how easy it would be to reproduce the paper: imagine you had to tell someone who had a strong CS or Linguistics background but was not immersed in the field how to reproduce the paper in an e-mail. Could you just hand them the submission? If not, how long would the e-mail be to fill in the gaps?  Confidence  If your confidence is low, please use the confidential comments section at the end of the form to let your meta-reviewer know which aspects of your review might not be reliable.  The review form also allows you to flag the paper for potential breaches of ACL’s anonymity period, or indicate that you know the authors’ identity from some source.  Best Paper Award  Reviewers are often a little too conservative in their nominations. After all, you just written down all of the flaws in the paper. And you may think about all of the best papers you’ve seen… but only after the review process and incorporating all of the great suggestions reviewers like you can make. Rather than thinking about the question as “is this a best paper” as is, consider the question more as “how could you argue that this will be best paper”. It is okay if this paper is unique in topic or technique, that could be what makes it a best paper!

If you have comments or questions that you would like the authors to respond to (beyond “thanks, we’ll fix this”), please move them to the “questions for the authors” and include them in the letter-numbered questions.  Be careful in suggesting citations of your own papers. When you have truly relevant related work, this is appropriate, but it is also potentially de-anonymizing (especially when the paper in question is not very well-known). One workaround is to suggest several citations, including yours. Reproducibility, Ethics Review, Anonymity Requirement and Overall Recommendation  The most important part of the review is your thorough comments. However, what many people focus on are numbers, particularly the “overall recommendation”. Thus, it would be remiss for our advice to overlook this part of the process.  ACL 2023 is trying something new this year. We are splitting this decision into two parts: how sound the paper is and how exciting you find the paper.  Soundness goes to how well the paper clearly states its claims and backs up them with evidence and argumentation. We want all papers to clear a minimum bar for presenting solid, thorough, technically sound research. We suspect that this will have lower variance than the other key metric, excitement. Please work with your fellow reviewers to come to a consensus: what are the claims of the paper and do you believe them?  Excitement captures the more subjective evaluations of the novelty/significance of the contributions, and their potential interesting-ness to the community. Because not everyone will calibrate their scores the same way (this will depend on the batch of papers you get, your research area, and the direction you think the field should go), make sure that your scores are justified in the text of the review.  The AC should be able to understand your justification of both scores to create a consensus score from all of the reviews. Please try to disentangle these two aspects in your review: e.g. even if you find a paper boring, it could still be sound and thorough.  Reproducibility  As you assess the reproducibility of the paper, think about not just whether the raw information to reproduce the paper are included. Also think about how easy it would be to reproduce the paper: imagine you had to tell someone who had a strong CS or Linguistics background but was not immersed in the field how to reproduce the paper in an e-mail. Could you just hand them the submission? If not, how long would the e-mail be to fill in the gaps?  Confidence  If your confidence is low, please use the confidential comments section at the end of the form to let your meta-reviewer know which aspects of your review might not be reliable.  The review form also allows you to flag the paper for potential breaches of ACL’s anonymity period, or indicate that you know the authors’ identity from some source.  Best Paper Award  Reviewers are often a little too conservative in their nominations. After all, you just written down all of the flaws in the paper. And you may think about all of the best papers you’ve seen… but only after the review process and incorporating all of the great suggestions reviewers like you can make. Rather than thinking about the question as “is this a best paper” as is, consider the question more as “how could you argue that this will be best paper”. It is okay if this paper is unique in topic or technique, that could be what makes it a best paper! \n\nQuestion:Is the submission of research paper double blind?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes. The submissions to ACL and any supplementary materials must not include authors’ names and affiliations, or the acknowledgments section. Self-references that reveal the authors’ identities must be avoided. For example, instead of “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” or even “We previously showed (Anonymous, 1991)… “ please use “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”.\nThe submissions should avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Please avoid any links to storage services like Dropbox (which may track the reviewers downloading the resources).

These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. For these reasons, ACL is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all the members, as well as participants at our events and in our programs.\n\nHarassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any ACL conference, associated event, or in ACL-affiliated online discussions. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. We aim for ACL-related activities to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific debate, but rather to promote it by ensuring that all are welcome to participate in the shared spirit of scientific inquiry. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of this procedure will render the complainant subject to the same sanctions as a violation of the anti-harassment policy.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. In addition, anyone who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact any member of the Professional Conduct Committee. Members of this committee are instructed to keep any such contact in strict confidence, and those who approach the committee will be consulted before any actions are taken.", "response": "I don't know the answer to that question based on the given context."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What requests are needed for visa letter?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>Invitation Letter>>content>>You can apply for an invitation letter for obtaining a VISA for ACL 2023 in this form if you have submitted a paper to the main conference ACL 2023 as an author (including co-authors) and your Softconf ID is associated with the submission.": 0.011643767356872559, "ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_5>>content>>As you know, ACL 2023 will be held in Toronto, Canada, July 9-14 2023.

The citizens of the countries eligible for eTas generally just need a valid passport, and can get their eTAs issued in minutes. But applying for a visa takes quite a long time to process at this moment. To give a few examples, as of January 20 2023 (ACL submission deadline), this official calculator made the following predictions for the expected processing time for applications from:  Application from China: 28 days Application from Japan: 73 days Application from India: 130 days Application from Brazil: 158 days Application from France: 189 days Application from Russia: 239 days Application from Kenya: 289 days  Note that these are estimates based on where the application is processed, not the country of origin. The citizens of Japan or France don’t need visas to visit Canada, but if a citizen of another country needs to apply for a Canadian visa while residing in France or Japan - the above is the official processing time estimate.  We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment. If you need a visa to visit Canada, you will need to use the above calculator for your location and see if you are willing to bet that the processing will be completed in time. The application fee is 100 CAD.  Additionally you may be required to submit biometrics. It is possible to check if you need to do that here. The biometrics fee is 85 CAD, and submitting is only possible in dedicated visa application centers, not necessarily available in all countries. If you are required to submit biometrics, the existing centers can be searched here.  If you are planning to try to attend in person and need the visa, we recommend that you start the visa application as soon as possible.

In the case that a student requires reimbursement after the conference for LATE volunteer registration, the student must provide receipt of paid registration fees from debit or bank account (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Assistant Director of Events, Megs Haddad (acl.megshaddad@gmail.com).\n\nStudents are required to fill out the Volunteer Reimbursement Form that will be available once selected. In this form, please attach proof of all receipts to be refunded. Preferred refund method for in person conference attendance is Cash at the event (if the form is complete and all receipts are turned in). If this is not possible, a valid mailing address is required to receive a reimbursement check, a valid email address required for PayPal payments, or complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in the event that check reimbursement is not possible).\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Selection Criteria>>Applications will be evaluated based on the submitted materials and provided justifications. Privacy will be respected and preference will be given to first-time attendees and applicants from underrepresented groups who are presenting a paper at the main conference/the Student Research Workshop,/any of the workshops associated with ACL, and those who do not have other means of support. As the conference will be hybrid and we are aware of the current Canadian Visa issues that people from underrepresented groups are dealing with, we may provide more virtual waivers than travel grants to help as many people as possible.\n\nACL2023>>Registration>>Registration>>content>>Virtual Pricing>>content>>introduction>>For a Discounted/sliding scale Virtual Registration Subsidy ($0-100), apply here.\nGiven the large real costs of all conference paper presentations (whether virtual or in-person), all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered. If this is prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Registration and ACL Membership Subsidies>>This is for getting a waiver for ACL registration. You can also request ACL membership if applicable. You will be asked to justify your application. For instance, you can say:\n\n“I have an accepted paper at the main conference. I would like to apply for a registration fee waiver because my fees are not funded by my organization/institution.”\n“I have an accepted paper at an ACL Workshop/ the SRW/ SemEval shared task, I live in a developing country [name the country] and I/my institution cannot afford the registration fees.”\n\nNote that if you are applying for a registration fee waiver, you SHOULD NOT register for the conference until you hear from us about your D&I subsidy application. That way, you would not have to ask for a reimbursement, since you would not be charged in the first place.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we will take your justification into account when processing your application.\n\nQuestion:What are the criteria for selection for financial aid for ACL2023 virtual registration?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your country of residence, employment position, monthly income range, available financial support from your employer/university, and special circumstances.", "response": "The criteria for selection for financial aid for ACL2023 virtual registration include (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "What is the deadline to apply for an invitation letter for obtaining a VISA for ACL2023?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_3>>content>>content_4>>content>>content_2>>content>>content_12>>Why this is problematic>>Per ACL policy, missing references to prior highly relevant work is a problem if such work was published 3+ months before the submission deadline (December 2022).
