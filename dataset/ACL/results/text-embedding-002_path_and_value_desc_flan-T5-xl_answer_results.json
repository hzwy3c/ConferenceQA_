This is difficult to combat because in a system in which the reviewer provides a single recommendation score, such subjective preferences are inevitably tangled with judgements on the other aspects of the paper.\nACL’23 is experimenting with an alternative paper scoring system. Instead of the traditional “overall recommendation” score, we explicitly ask reviewers about whether the submission presents sound research, and how exciting they personally find it. The former criterion can be estimated more objectively, as long as the reviewers have sufficient expertise. The latter is inevitably more subjective, and may reflect the reviewers’ own research agenda, perception of novelty, potential utility to themselves or their sub-community, or other such factors that are hard to disentangle – but reviewers do wish to communicate. You can see the full form and its scoring rubrics here.\nThe pros of this separation of “soundness” and “excitement” are as follows:\nthe reviewers should be able to provide more accurate estimates of soundness by disentangling their own research interests and preferences;\nthe reviewer job is easier (especially the new reviewers, who may not have a very clear idea of what is expected of an *ACL paper, could find it hard to make that call);\nthe authors receive more actionable information from the review: e.g. instead of overall score “3” you get “2” in soundness and “4” in excitement, you know that you need to revise and resubmit, and if it’s the other way round - then you just were not lucky to find a reviewer who shares your interests;\nthe authors can focus their response on soundness (where reasonable argumentation is possible) rather than excitement (where it may not be very productive to try to convince the reviewers that their research tastes are wrong);\nthe chairs have more information for assembling the program and planning the conference sessions;\nthrough correlating these scores with paper types,we can learn the implicit and explicit norms and attitudes in the field to improve the peer review process.\nOne complaint we’ve seen on social media is that the old system of an overall score offered a better clue as to whether a paper is going to get in and are disappointed because they don’t see such a straightforward mapping here. However, even the regular “overall recommendation” could only be trusted for the relatively few papers with all top scores or all low scores. In the middle, much is at the discretion of the chairs, who rely on the full review text, consider reviewer confidence and expertise, etc. It’s the same in our case, except that the chairs get a bit more information to go on. Our hope is that this information will help chairs come to better conclusions.\nLet’s dig into this a bit more:\nneither score is functionally equivalent to the traditional “overall recommendation” score (unfortunately, softconf shows statistics for only one of them in the review reports, but that does not mean it’s the same as the old score);\nthe “soundness” score is more important: non-scientifically-sound papers should not be published anywhere. This follows from our CFP and common sense. (Some reviewers saw early review reports that highlighted excitement scores but not soundness thought that meant excitement is more central to accept/reject decisions; this is certainly not the case. This was just a symptom of Softconf catching up to the new review criteria, and it is now fixed.)\nthe “excitement” score helps decision makers understand reviews better. In conferences using a single recommendation score, a paper with three middling scores is difficult to make a decision about. In ACL’23, if such a paper scores high on soundness but low on excitement, it’s clear that it should be accepted somewhere. If the soundness scores are all low but some reviewers are excited, this probably means the paper is a great idea but needs more development. That said, as in any conference, the chairs have discretion based on their high-level knowledge of the field and editorial priorities. They may also downweigh or discard reviews that have serious issues, low reviewer confidence, etc.\nThe primary purpose of the author response period is always to clarify any misunderstandings and to improve the accuracy of the reviews. It is the same in our case. We recommend to focus on soundness, because it is realistically the score that is more likely to be improved through clarifications, than “this is not surprising” kind of comments. That said, the authors are of course welcome to address any reviewer points that they wish. An additional quality assurance step that is new at ACL’23 is that the authors can flag serious issues in reviews by their type for the chairs.\nWe recognize that this is new and different. It’s an experiment. Thus, to help everyone better understand what’s going on, we are sharing the distribution of the “excitement” and “soundness” scores below. As you can see, most submissions are in the middle of the distribution, just like with the regular single-score process.\nOverall distribution for 'soundness' and 'excitement' scores at ACL 2023 (pre-rebuttal)": 0.15437787771224976}, "from": "ACL2023>>Program>>AWARDS>>Best Papers>>content>>introduction", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

We seek proposals in all areas of computational linguistics, broadly conceived to include related disciplines. ​ We invite proposals for two types of tutorials: ​\n\nCutting-edge: tutorials that cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any ACL/EMNLP/EACL/NAACL-HLT/AACL/COLING related tutorial (see the list of tutorials in the past 4 years).\nIntroductory: tutorials that provide introductions to related fields that are potentially relevant for the computational linguistics community (e.g., linguistics, bioinformatics, machine learning techniques).\n\nIn both cases, the aim of a tutorial is primarily to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications. Presentations of particular technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations.\n\nTutorials will be held at one of the following conference venues: ​\n\nEACL 2023 in Dubrovnik, Croatia (hybrid) on May 2-6, 2023.\nACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada (hybrid) on July 9-14, 2023.\nEMNLP 2023 in Singapore on TBD, 2023.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>Fee Waiving>>Up to 3 instructors per tutorial can have their registration fees waived for the main conference and any subset of co-located tutorials and workshops.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>EMNLP>>TBA\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>Evaluation Criteria>>Each tutorial proposal will be evaluated according to its clarity and preparedness, novelty or timely character of the topic, instructors’ experience, likely audience interest, open access of the tutorial instructional material, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nQuestion:What kind of proposals are invited for the tutorials at the EACL 2023, ACL 2023, and EMNLP 2023 conferences?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Proposals are invited for two types of tutorials: Cutting-edge and Introductory.

This form must be completed FIRST in order to receive the ACL Conference 2023 LINK to have registration fees waived. If for any reason you are not accepted, the Registrar will work with you to secure early registration fee rates. In the case that a student requires reimbursement after the conference for LATE volunteer registration, the student must provide receipt of paid registration fees from debit or bank account (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Assistant Director of Events, Megs Haddad (acl.megshaddad@gmail.com).\n\nStudents are required to fill out the Volunteer Reimbursement Form that will be available once selected. In this form, please attach proof of all receipts to be refunded. Preferred refund method for in person conference attendance is Cash at the event (if the form is complete and all receipts are turned in). If this is not possible, a valid mailing address is required to receive a reimbursement check, a valid email address required for PayPal payments, or complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in the event that check reimbursement is not possible).\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>content>>Student Volunteer Chairs>>Contact: tyu@cs.hku.hk, Ayah.zirikly@gmail.com\n\nTao Yu, University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong)\nAyah Zirikly, Johns Hopkins University (USA)\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>title>>Student Volunteer Program\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Volunteers>>content>>introduction>>A limited number of student volunteers are needed for the success of The 61st Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023).
