This includes a total of 3 best papers, 4 special awards papers (Resource Award, Social Impact Award, Reproduction Award, Theme Paper Award) and 39 outstanding papers. Additionally, there are Area Chair Awards, where the Senior Area Chairs of each track have the opportunity to nominate one of their papers for a separate award."}, {"query": "What does the Full Conference In-person Registration Fee Include?", "output": "The Full Conference In-person Registration Fee includes admission to all in-person meeting sessions and the exhibition as well as the entire virtual program, attendance to all recorded sessions on demand for at least one month following the meeting, a conference bag and materials, tea and coffee breaks throughout the meeting, admission to the Welcome Reception on Sunday 9th of July at The Westin Harbour Castle, Metropolitan Ballroom including light canapes and a welcome drink, and admission to the Social Dinner on Tuesday 11th July at The Steam Whistle Brewer, including buffet dinner."}, {"query": "Who are the intended recipients for Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration?", "output": "The intended recipients for Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration are researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate in ACL events due to financial constraints. The selection for financial aid will consider the applicant's country of residence, employment position, monthly income range, available financial support from the employer/university, and special circumstances. Prioritization is given to those in the greatest financial need, and generally, this funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher income countries in Asia and the Middle East."}, {"query": "What kind of proposals are invited for the tutorials at the EACL 2023, ACL 2023, and EMNLP 2023 conferences?", "output": "The EACL 2023, ACL 2023, and EMNLP 2023 conferences are inviting proposals for two types of tutorials. The first type is Cutting-edge tutorials, which cover advances in newly emerging areas not previously covered in any related tutorial from the specified organizations. The second type is Introductory tutorials, that provide introductions to related fields that might be relevant for the computational linguistics community, such as linguistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning techniques. The aim of these tutorials is to help understand a scientific problem, its tractability, and its theoretical and practical implications."}, {"query": "What are the responsibilities of the organizers of the accepted proposals?", "output": "The organizers of the accepted proposals are responsible for publicizing and running the workshop, which includes reviewing submissions, producing the camera-ready workshop proceedings, organizing the meeting days, and ensuring all participants are aware of ACL’s anti-harassment policy. They should adhere to all deadlines, as failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time could result in the workshop being excluded from the proceedings and author indexes. They cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they can set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Organizers need to follow the submission, reviewing, and preparation timeline for each conference, deviating only when absolutely necessary and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs."}, {"query": "What are the possible topics for discussion under the theme track 'Reality Check'?", "output": "The possible topics of discussion under the theme track 'Reality Check' include:\n\n1. How reliably do the leaderboard scores translate to improvements in real-world use of the models?\n2. How reliably do the leaderboard scores compare competing models?\n3. What tasks can the NLP systems claim to have “solved”, if any?\n4. Have performance improvements been accompanied by growth in the scientific understanding (of language, cognition, or deep learning technology)? In what ways?\n5. What can the NLP venues do to improve reporting?\n6. Right for the wrong reasons\n7. Lessons from deployment\n8. Generalizability and non-generalizability\n9.

Forgotten lessons."}, {"query": "What is the anti-harassment policy at ACL events?", "output": "The anti-harassment policy at ACL events includes maintaining an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and embraces diversity. Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome. This includes speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in a conference or an event. ACL-related activities aim to be an environment where any form of harassment does not occur, including those based on race, gender, religion, age, color, appearance, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Harassment may also include degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Vexatious complaints and willful misuse of the policy may also lead to sanctions. Violations should be reported to the Professional Conduct Committee."}, {"query": "What are the guidelines about video submission for the system demonstration?", "output": "The guidelines for video submission for the system demonstration are as follows: \n\n- The video should be short, no more than 2 minutes long.\n- The video should demonstrate the system and its functionality. \n- The video can be a screencast with audio narration which is a natural choice for demos that can be presented on a screen. Alternatively, a video showing a user interacting with the system can be used.\n- The production quality of the video is not considered important, and the video can be a simple screencast of the software being demoed with zero to minimal editing efforts.\n- It is recommended to publish the video on YouTube or another website and include the link in the paper. If one prefers not to publicly upload a screencast, the video (in MPEG4 format) can be submitted as supplementary material through START while submitting the paper.\n  \nNote: The video will be used to evaluate the paper, but it will not be published unless requested."}, {"query": "What is the cancelation policy of the conference?", "output": "The cancellation policy of the conference indicates that full refund will be given for cancellations made one month or more prior to the conference (by June 09, 2023), subject to a potential $50 processing fee. If the cancellation is done up to three weeks before the conference (by June 16, 2023), the registrant will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid beyond the first $200. Cancellations made two weeks prior to the start of the conference (by June 23, 2023), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount, although they will be able to retain the current full-year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have virtual access.\n\nHowever, exceptions are made for cancellations due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness preventing travel to the conference. In these cases, a full refund will be given, regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office (subject to up to a $50 processing fee), provided documentation supporting the reasons for cancellation is submitted."}, {"query": "What is the multiple submission policy of the ACL 2023?", "output": "The multiple submission policy of the ACL 2023 stipulates that any paper currently under review in a journal or at another conference cannot be considered. The submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the ACL 2023 review period. This policy applies to all refereed and archival conferences and workshops, and ACL Rolling Reviews. A paper will not be considered if it significantly overlaps in content or results with papers to be published or already published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to ACL 2023 must ensure their submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) in content or results.\n\nAlso, submissions of identical or closely related work to multiple ACL 2023 tracks will be treated as duplicate submissions and will be rejected without review. Authors should include the papers their submission overlaps or extends with in the references section.\n\nIn principle, papers submitted directly to ACL must not be under review for any other archival venue during the ACL review process. However, an exception is made for works under review for EACL 2023 or ICLR 2023, to account for overlapping submission due and notification of acceptance dates. These works can be submitted to ACL but must be declared at submission time and withdrawn from ACL no later than January 31 (for EACL 2023) or January 22 (for ICLR 2023) if accepted. Papers submitted to ICLR 2023 and ACL 2023 must also adhere to the anonymization policy of ACL 2023."}]
