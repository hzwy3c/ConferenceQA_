It is crucial that organizers commit to all deadlines. In particular, failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the unified proceedings and author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timelines for each of the conferences are given below. The workshop organizers should not deviate from this schedule unless absolutely necessary, and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs.\n\nThe ACL has a set of policies on workshops.

The workshop organizers must bear all other costs independently.\n\nThe two pages for information about organizers, program committee, and references must include:\n\nThe names, affiliations, and email addresses of the organizers, with a brief statement (2-5 sentences) of their research interests, areas of expertise, and experience in organizing workshops and related events.\nA list of Program Committee members, with an indication of which members have already agreed. Organizers should do their best to estimate the number of submissions (especially for recurring workshops) in order to (a) ensure a sufficient number of reviewers so that each paper receives 3 reviews, and (b) anticipate that no one is committed to reviewing more than 3 papers. This practice is likely to ensure on-time and thoughtful reviews.\nAn indication whether the workshop will consider papers submitted through ACL Rolling Review (ARR); an indication whether the workshop will use OpenReview as a platform (both to take papers from ARR and for their own review); whether the workshop will only use START as a platform, and will not use ARR.

In particular, failure to produce the camera-ready proceedings on time will lead to the exclusion of the workshop from the unified proceedings and author indexes. Workshop organizers cannot accept submissions for publication that will be (or have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own policies on simultaneous submission and review. Since the conferences will occur at different times, the timelines for the submission and reviewing of workshop papers, and the preparation of camera-ready copies, will be different for each conference. Suggested timelines for each of the conferences are given below. The workshop organizers should not deviate from this schedule unless absolutely necessary, and with explicit agreement from the relevant Workshop Chairs.\n\nThe ACL has a set of policies on workshops. You can find the ACL’s general policies on workshops, the financial policy for workshops, and the financial policy for SIG workshops in the Conference Handbook.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Workshops>>Submission Information>>Proposals should be submitted as PDF documents. Note that submissions should be ready to be turned into a Call for Papers to the workshop within one week of notification.\n\nThe proposals should be at most two pages for the main proposal and at most two additional pages for information about the organizers, program committee, and references. Thus, the whole proposal should not be more than four pages long.\n\nThe two pages for the main proposal must include:\n\nA title and a brief description of the workshop topic and content.\nA list of invited speakers, if applicable, with an indication of which ones have already agreed and which are indicative, and sources of funding for the speakers.\nAn estimate of the number of attendees.\nDepending on the global situation of COVID-19, some conferences might take place only virtually. We request submissions to contain a brief discussion on measures planned to make sure a workshop is successful and productive in case of a virtual-only attendance.\nA description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop, and estimate of the number of participants.\nA description of special requirements and technical needs.\nThe preferred venue(s) (EACL / ACL / EMNLP), if any, and description of any constraints (e.g., if the workshop is compatible with only one of these events, logistically, thematically or otherwise)\nIf the workshop has been held before, a note specifying where previous workshops were held, how many submissions the workshop received, how many papers were accepted (also specify if they were not regular papers, e.g., shared task system description papers), and how many attendees the workshop attracted.\n\nNote that the only financial support available to workshops is a single free workshop registration for an invited speaker. The workshop organizers must bear all other costs independently.\n\nThe two pages for information about organizers, program committee, and references must include:\n\nThe names, affiliations, and email addresses of the organizers, with a brief statement (2-5 sentences) of their research interests, areas of expertise, and experience in organizing workshops and related events.\nA list of Program Committee members, with an indication of which members have already agreed. Organizers should do their best to estimate the number of submissions (especially for recurring workshops) in order to (a) ensure a sufficient number of reviewers so that each paper receives 3 reviews, and (b) anticipate that no one is committed to reviewing more than 3 papers. This practice is likely to ensure on-time and thoughtful reviews.\nAn indication whether the workshop will consider papers submitted through ACL Rolling Review (ARR); an indication whether the workshop will use OpenReview as a platform (both to take papers from ARR and for their own review); whether the workshop will only use START as a platform, and will not use ARR. In making this choice, please pay careful attention to the ARR deadlines and conference notifications.\nReferences\n\nSubmission is electronic at the following link: https://softconf.com/n/acl-workshops2023.\n\nThe workshop proposals will be evaluated according to their originality and impact, and the quality of the organizing team and Programme Committee.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>Important Dates>>list>>list_2>>event>>Notification of acceptance \n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Proposals>>Tutorials>>Submission Details>>list>>list_20>>OPTIONAL: We welcome proposals on special conference themes.

I would need $$ USD to increase my quote as my current plan is not suitable for video conferencing (add a link to the tariff of your internet subscriber if possible).”\n“I worry about my safety and privacy because … and I would like to apply for a VPN subsidy of $$ USD to avoid surveillance (link to the service provider if possible).”\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>introduction>>ACL 2023 is providing D&I funds for registration, caregiving, bandwidth, travel, VPN subsidies and volunteer opportunities. We strongly encourage researchers from developing countries and marginalised communities, students, and researchers with financial hurdles to apply for both subsidies and volunteering opportunities to maximise their chances of getting their registration fees waived.\nPlease apply for subsidies before the 31st of May using this link.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Travel and Accommodation Subsidies>>We are also providing travel and accommodation subsidies. Priority will be given to authors, first-time attendees and folks from underrepresented communities with financial hurdles.\n\nIf you would like to attend the in-person meeting please keep in mind that if your waiver application is accepted, We are only able to pay in advance for some rooms at the conference hotel (the price needs to be included in the amount of money that you are requesting). Other accommodations and travel expenses (e.g., flight tickets) can only be reimbursed after the conference.\n\nThe number of accepted applicants and the amount of money subsidized will vary depending on the number of applicants and the funding availability.\n\nPlease answer questions regarding whether you have previously attended any *CL conferences (NAACL, EACL, AACL, ACL, EMNLP and COLING) accurately as we would like to give all first-time attendees a chance.\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Selection Criteria>>Applications will be evaluated based on the submitted materials and provided justifications. Privacy will be respected and preference will be given to first-time attendees and applicants from underrepresented groups who are presenting a paper at the main conference/the Student Research Workshop,/any of the workshops associated with ACL, and those who do not have other means of support. As the conference will be hybrid and we are aware of the current Canadian Visa issues that people from underrepresented groups are dealing with, we may provide more virtual waivers than travel grants to help as many people as possible.\n\nACL2023>>Participants>>Participants Information>>Invitation Letter>>content>>You can apply for an invitation letter for obtaining a VISA for ACL 2023 in this form if you have submitted a paper to the main conference ACL 2023 as an author (including co-authors) and your Softconf ID is associated with the submission.\n\nQuestion:Are there any subsidies available for bandwidth or VPN expenses for ACL 2023 participants?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Yes", "response": "Yes, there are subsidies available for bandwidth or VPN expenses for ACL 2023 participants."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "Can I submit a paper to ACL 2023 if I missed the abstract submission deadline?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_3>>content>>content_4>>content>>content_2>>content>>content_12>>Why this is problematic>>Per ACL policy, missing references to prior highly relevant work is a problem if such work was published 3+ months before the submission deadline (December 2022).

We don’t know how accurate these estimates are. We have applied to register the conference with the immigration authorities, but it is unclear if that will result in any expedited treatment.

Students should make travel arrangements and accommodations independent of the results of the application.\n\nVolunteer Registration Application ACL Toronto 23\n\nPlease DO NOT REGISTER for the ACL 2023 Conference until someone has reached out to you or you have received a Congratulatory email confirming your Volunteer Service Acceptance. Once you have received this Acceptance notification you will receive a special link to register in which your registration fees are waived. Additionally, a separate email containing a Volunteer Registration form will be sent to you, in which you can list what volunteer preference task you would like based on your skillset (i.e. registration, volunteer coordinator, poster session liaison etc.). This form must be completed FIRST in order to receive the ACL Conference 2023 LINK to have registration fees waived. If for any reason you are not accepted, the Registrar will work with you to secure early registration fee rates. In the case that a student requires reimbursement after the conference for LATE volunteer registration, the student must provide receipt of paid registration fees from debit or bank account (i.e., a business expense report) to the ACL Assistant Director of Events, Megs Haddad (acl.megshaddad@gmail.com).\n\nStudents are required to fill out the Volunteer Reimbursement Form that will be available once selected. In this form, please attach proof of all receipts to be refunded. Preferred refund method for in person conference attendance is Cash at the event (if the form is complete and all receipts are turned in). If this is not possible, a valid mailing address is required to receive a reimbursement check, a valid email address required for PayPal payments, or complete banking details to receive a wire reimbursement (only in the event that check reimbursement is not possible).\n\nACL2023>>Calls>>Call for Subsidies>>Diversity and Inclusion Program>>content>>Travel and Accommodation Subsidies>>We are also providing travel and accommodation subsidies.

Other accommodations and travel expenses (e.g., flight tickets) can only be reimbursed after the conference.\n\nThe number of accepted applicants and the amount of money subsidized will vary depending on the number of applicants and the funding availability.\n\nPlease answer questions regarding whether you have previously attended any *CL conferences (NAACL, EACL, AACL, ACL, EMNLP and COLING) accurately as we would like to give all first-time attendees a chance.\n\nQuestion:If I have to cancel my registration due to failure to obtain a visa, will I get a refund?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Cancellation due to failure to obtain a visa will be refunded the full amount paid (minus up to $50 processing fee) regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office.", "response": "Yes, if you have to cancel your registration due to failure to obtain a visa, you will get a refund of the full amount paid, minus up to a $50 processing fee."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "Who should I contact if I have questions about my registration or payment for ACL2023?", "retrieve_results": {"ACL2023>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Main Conference>>Papers>>Short Papers>>Short Papers_21>>authors>>authors_4>>Curtis Langlotz": 0.209506094455719, "ACL2023>>Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog>>ACL 2023 Blog_3>>content>>content_4>>content>>content_2>>content>>content_12>>Why this is problematic>>Per ACL policy, missing references to prior highly relevant work is a problem if such work was published 3+ months before the submission deadline (December 2022).
