After five years as a faculty member at Carnegie-Mellon he became a fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and moved to the University of Toronto where he is now an emeritus professor. He is also the Chief Scientific Adviser at the Vector Institute.\n\nHe was one of the researchers who introduced the backpropagation algorithm and the first to use backpropagation for learning word embeddings. His other contributions to neural network research include Boltzmann machines, distributed representations, time-delay neural nets, mixtures of experts, variational learning and deep learning. His research group in Toronto made major breakthroughs in deep learning that revolutionized speech recognition and object classification.\n\nHe is a fellow of the UK Royal Society and a foreign member of the US National Academy of Engineering, the US National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His awards include the David E. Rumelhart prize, the IJCAI award for research excellence, the Killam prize for Engineering, the Royal Society Royal Medal, the NSERC Herzberg Gold Medal, the IEEE James Clerk Maxwell Gold medal, the NEC C&C award, the BBVA award, the Honda Prize and the Turing Award.": 0.12825781106948853, "ACL2023>>Program>>EVENTS>>Keynotes>>content>>speakers>>speakers_1>>name>>Geoffrey Hinton": 0.12995225191116333, "ACL2023>>Program>>EVENTS>>Keynotes>>content>>speakers>>speakers_1>>description>>I will briefly describe the forty year history of neural net language models with particular attention to whether they understand what they are saying.
