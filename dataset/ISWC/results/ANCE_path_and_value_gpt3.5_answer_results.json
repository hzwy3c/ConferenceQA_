Despite the recent advancements in the field, AD is still far from achieving full autonomy due to core technical problems inherent in AD. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic AI and the methods for knowledge-infused learning are showing exciting ways of leveraging external knowledge within machine/deep learning solutions, with the potential benefits for interpretability, explainability, robustness, and transferability. In this tutorial, we will examine the use of knowledge-infused learning for three core state-of-the-art technical achievements within the AD domain. With a collaborative team from both academia and industry, we will demonstrate recent innovations using real-world datasets.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Accepted Papers by Track>>Research Track>>Research Track_9>>title>>Infusing Contextual Knowledge Graphs for Visual Object Recognition\n\nQuestion:Who is the author of the paper 'Visual Relationship Detection using Knowledge Graphs for Neural-Symbolic AI'?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Dave Herron", "response": "Dave Herron"}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What is the title of the paper written by Ines Akaichi?", "retrieve_results": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Doctoral Consortium>>Accepted Papers>>Accepted Papers_1>>author>>Ines Akaichi": 0.013600826263427734, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Doctoral Consortium>>table>>table_8>>agenda item>>PAPER SESSION 2\nMentors: Ernesto Jimenez-ruiz, Hemant Purohit, William Van Woensel, Maria Esther Vidal\n1.

His work spans from the theory of knowledge representation and formal logic to practical applications in knowledge graphs and symbolic AI. He has made influential contributions to Wikipedia’s free knowledge graph Wikidata, to the W3C Web Ontology Language OWL 2, and to several open source reasoning systems. His current interests include rule-based computation, ontological query answering, efficient reasoning, and the use of these methods in explainable and trustworthy AI applications.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Accepted Papers>>Accepted Papers by Track>>Research Track>>Research Track_5>>title>>Towards Neural Network Interpretability using Commonsense Knowledge Graphs\n\nQuestion:What is the URL of the video related to the poster titled 'New Ontology and Knowledge Graph for University Curriculum Recommendation'?\nAnswer:", "gt": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85b9D20q-Jo", "response": "I don't know the answer to that question."}, {"type": "extraction_complex", "query": "What is the title of Francesca Rossi's presentation?", "retrieve_results": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_1>>speaker>>bio>>Francesca Rossi is an IBM Fellow and the IBM AI Ethics Global Leader.": 0.01458728313446045, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_1>>slides>>https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ISWC2022.1-Slides-FrancescaRossi.pdf": 0.01617431640625, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_1>>speaker>>name>>Francesca Rossi": 0.016479849815368652, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_3>>table>>table_11>>slides>>https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ISWC2022.1-Slides-FrancescaRossi.pdf": 0.01700061559677124, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_1>>speaker>>photo>>https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/speaker-foto2018-small-Francesca-Rossi-pkh85ukyzpqtq9rz8yf4cj5iz2kfe543ss5k2bp9dk.jpg": 0.017046451568603516}, "from": "ISWC2023>>ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers[1]>>title", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
