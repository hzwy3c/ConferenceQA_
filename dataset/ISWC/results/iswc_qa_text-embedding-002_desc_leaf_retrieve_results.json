As an alternative, neuro-symbolic approaches are gaining significant attention. However, the existing methods can not deal with very expressive ontology languages. Other than that, some SPARQL query engines also support reasoning, but their performance also is still limited. To find and improve these performance bottlenecks of the reasons, we ideally need several real-world ontologies that span the broad spectrum in terms of their size and expressivity. However, that is often not the case. One of the potential reasons for the ontology developers to not build ontologies that vary in terms of size and expressivity is the performance bottleneck of the reasons. SemREC aims to deal with this chicken and egg problem. The second edition of this challenge includes the following tasks. Task-1. Ontologies.
