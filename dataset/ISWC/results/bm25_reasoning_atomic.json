Such KGs are available through various interfaces, such as data dumps, Linked Data Platform, SPARQL endpoints and Triple Pattern Fragments. In addition, various sources produce streaming data. Efficiently querying these sources is of central importance for the scalability of Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies. To exploit the massive amount of data to its full potential, users should be able to query and combine this data easily and effectively. This workshop at the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) seeks original articles describing theoretical and practical methods and techniques for fostering, querying, consuming, and benchmarking KGs."}, {"question": "What is the focus of the 'Wikidata Workshop'?", "answer": "1.
