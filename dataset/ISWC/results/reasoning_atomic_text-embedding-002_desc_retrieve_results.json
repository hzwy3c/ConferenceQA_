Wikidata acts as the central source of common, open structured data used by Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others. It is used in a variety of academic and industrial applications. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of scientific publications around Wikidata. While there are a number of venues for the Wikidata community to exchange, none of those publish original research. We want to bridge the gap between these communities and the research events and give the research-focused part of the Wikidata community a venue to meet and exchange information and knowledge. The Wikidata Workshop 2022 focuses on the challenges and opportunities of working on a collaborative open-domain knowledge graph such as Wikidata, which is edited by an international and multilingual community. We encourage submissions that observe the influence such a knowledge graph has on the web of data, as well as those working on improving this knowledge graph itself.

As such it is studied from a social science and humanities perspective as well as from a computer science one. Recently, knowledge graphs have shown the potential to become an enabling technology for the hybridisation and collaboration between these two research worlds. They can be used for feeding AI applications to support musicologists, musicians, producers, etc. in tasks such as music management, analysis, composition, and generation. And they are key for developing a new generation of music information retrieval applications, based on interlinked knowledge as opposed to isolated collections.

On the other hand, Deep Learning methods have also become an important area of research, achieving some important breakthrough in various research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Recognition. In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical that the communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP join their forces in order to develop more effective algorithms and applications. This workshop, in the wake of other similar efforts at previous Semantic Web conferences such as ESWC2018 as DL4KGs and ISWC2018, ESWC2019, ESWC 2020, ISWC2021 aims to reinforce the relationships between these communities and foster inter-disciplinary research in the areas of KG, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.": 0.15580856800079346}, "What is the vision of the 'International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Technologies for Legal Documents (AI4LEGAL)'?": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_3>>abstract>>The legal domain applies to every aspect of people’s living and evolves continuously, building a huge network of interlinked legal documents. Therefore, it is important for a government to offer services that make legal information easily accessible to the citizens, enabling them to defend their rights, auditing public procurement, or to use legislation as part of their job. It is equally important to have professionals (lawyers, judges, administrations, etc.) access legislation in ways that allow them to do their job easily (e.g., they might need to be able to see the evolution of a law over time). Despite recent efforts to make all this accessible and transparent to both citizens and the companies involved, the level of implementation in different countries and layers of public administration still makes access difficult. For this reason, in the age of the Web it is important to develop applications for citizens and professionals easily, by connecting the available legal information with other kinds of government or private sector information.

Open Data plays a catalyst role in the way structured information is exploited on a large scale. A traditional view of digitally preserving these datasets by “pickling and locking them away” for future use, like groceries, conflicts with their evolution. There are several approaches and frameworks (Linked Data Stack, PoolParty Suite, etc.) that manage a full life-cycle of the Data Web. More specifically, these solutions are expected to tackle major issues such as the synchronisation problem (monitoring changes), the curation problem (repairing data imperfections), the appraisal problem (assessing the quality of a dataset), the citation problem (how to cite a particular version of a dataset), the archiving problem (retrieving a specific version of a dataset), and the sustainability problem (preserving at scale, ensuring long-term access).

While there are a number of venues for the Wikidata community to exchange, none of those publish original research. We want to bridge the gap between these communities and the research events and give the research-focused part of the Wikidata community a venue to meet and exchange information and knowledge. The Wikidata Workshop 2022 focuses on the challenges and opportunities of working on a collaborative open-domain knowledge graph such as Wikidata, which is edited by an international and multilingual community. We encourage submissions that observe the influence such a knowledge graph has on the web of data, as well as those working on improving this knowledge graph itself.

Inspired by very different backgrounds – Web data exchange and mathematical logic – the two worlds have sometimes be perceived as complementary, even conflicting. But the general trend towards knowledge graphs made such discussions irrelevant, and modern knowledge models, such as Wikidata, often combine instance and schema data side by side. In my invited talk, I will explain how this unification of data and ontology may present an opportunity to the Semantic Web, and discuss how recent results in rule-based reasoning may provide a basis for overcoming related challenges. This involves some interesting insights about the expressive power that is conferred by extending rules with value invention – the ability to create fresh blank nodes. Besides the theoretical effects of this addition, we can also demonstrate concrete practical uses of this expressive power.": 0.18796837329864502, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Panel>>Panel_1>>Panelists>>Panelists_3>>slides>>https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Panel1-Ilaria-Tiddi.pdf": 0.1896275281906128}, "What are Markus Krötzsch's current interests?": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_3>>speaker>>bio>>Markus Krötzsch is a full professor for Knowledge-Based Systems at TU Dresden.": 0.17489558458328247, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_3>>speaker>>name>>Markus Krötzsch": 0.17702287435531616, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Keynote Speakers>>Keynote Speakers_3>>speaker>>introduction>>He obtained his Ph.D. from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in 2010, conducted his post-doctoral research at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford, and moved on to establish his research group at TU Dresden in 2013.
