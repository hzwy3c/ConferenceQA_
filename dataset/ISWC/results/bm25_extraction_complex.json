Please note the following key requirements:\nHTML template: any tooling or process can be used to produce the HTML. \nContent: the full content of the article must be human-readable with HTML alone. The use of CSS and JavaScript is encouraged, but should not interfere with the accessibility of the content.\nOffline-friendly: there must not be any external dependencies (e.g., a network connection) to retrieve, to render, or to manipulate the content of the article. \nPrivacy: scripts must not be used to identify or track readers. \nView: the rendered article (HTML+CSS) should have the \"look and feel\" of the LNCS authoring guidelines. Pixel-perfection is not expected. This is to ensure visual consistency of the proceedings as well as to have comparative page limits with the print-based publication. The HTML article has to be compliant with the page limit constraint.\nIt should be possible to read the HTML contributions on an average desktop computer or mobile computer that is equipped with a reasonably current, Javascript-enabled Web browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome/Chromium, Internet Explorer, Brave, Safari). We encourage authors to make their articles as accessible as possible (for reading and interacting) because different consumers (in this case initially the reviewers and chairs) may have different environments and abilities.."}, {"question": "Who is the Program Committee Member affiliated with Google, US?", "answer": "1.
