KGs are large networks of real-world entities described in terms of their semantic types and their relationships to each other. On the other hand, Deep Learning methods have also become an important area of research, achieving some important breakthrough in various research fields, especially Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Image Recognition. In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical that the communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP join their forces in order to develop more effective algorithms and applications.

Open Data plays a catalyst role in the way structured information is exploited on a large scale. A traditional view of digitally preserving these datasets by “pickling and locking them away” for future use, like groceries, conflicts with their evolution. There are several approaches and frameworks (Linked Data Stack, PoolParty Suite, etc.) that manage a full life-cycle of the Data Web. More specifically, these solutions are expected to tackle major issues such as the synchronisation problem (monitoring changes), the curation problem (repairing data imperfections), the appraisal problem (assessing the quality of a dataset), the citation problem (how to cite a particular version of a dataset), the archiving problem (retrieving a specific version of a dataset), and the sustainability problem (preserving at scale, ensuring long-term access). During the past seven years, the MEPDaW workshop series has been gathering researchers from the community around these challenges. So far the series successfully published more than 50 research efforts allowing more than 60 individual authors to present and share their ideas.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_1>>workshops>>workshops_1>>item>>item_3>>title>>The 8th Workshop on Managing the Evolution and Preservation of the Data Web (MEPDaW)\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_4>>webpage>>http://voila2022.visualdataweb.org/\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_2>>webpage>>https://wikidataworkshop.github.io/2022/\n\nQuestion:Which workshop is aimed at studying and discussing the evolution and preservation of the data web?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The '8th Workshop on Managing the Evolution and Preservation of the Data Web (MEPDaW)' is aimed at studying and discussing this issue.", "response": "The workshop aimed at studying and discussing the evolution and preservation of the data web is the 8th Workshop on Managing the Evolution and Preservation of the Data Web (MEPDaW)."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "What is the focus of the 'Wikidata Workshop'?", "retrieve_results": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_2>>abstract>>Wikidata is an open knowledge base hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation that can be read and edited by both humans and machines.
