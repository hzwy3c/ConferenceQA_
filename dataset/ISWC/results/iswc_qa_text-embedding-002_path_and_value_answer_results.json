Proposals for novel workshops on emerging topics that will become more important to the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Community in future years. The proposers will have to argue why the topic is of increasing importance for the community and why it will attract enough submissions and participants to support the development of the topic. These proposals will mainly be evaluated on the potential for future impact. The recommendation is for novel workshops to target a half-day format unless there is sufficient justification for a full-day workshop.\n\n2. The topic has to fall in the general scope of ISWC 2023.\n\n3. There should be a concrete plan for a workshop format that is varied, interesting, and suitable for the workshop audience and topic, and can be accommodated in online/hybrid settings.\n\n4. The topic proposal should have potential to attract a sufficiently broad community interested in the subject."}]
