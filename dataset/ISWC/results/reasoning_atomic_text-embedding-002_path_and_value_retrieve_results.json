As such it is studied from a social science and humanities perspective as well as from a computer science one. Recently, knowledge graphs have shown the potential to become an enabling technology for the hybridisation and collaboration between these two research worlds. They can be used for feeding AI applications to support musicologists, musicians, producers, etc. in tasks such as music management, analysis, composition, and generation. And they are key for developing a new generation of music information retrieval applications, based on interlinked knowledge as opposed to isolated collections.

Therefore, it is important for a government to offer services that make legal information easily accessible to the citizens, enabling them to defend their rights, auditing public procurement, or to use legislation as part of their job. It is equally important to have professionals (lawyers, judges, administrations, etc.) access legislation in ways that allow them to do their job easily (e.g., they might need to be able to see the evolution of a law over time). Despite recent efforts to make all this accessible and transparent to both citizens and the companies involved, the level of implementation in different countries and layers of public administration still makes access difficult. For this reason, in the age of the Web it is important to develop applications for citizens and professionals easily, by connecting the available legal information with other kinds of government or private sector information.

Open Data plays a catalyst role in the way structured information is exploited on a large scale. A traditional view of digitally preserving these datasets by “pickling and locking them away” for future use, like groceries, conflicts with their evolution. There are several approaches and frameworks (Linked Data Stack, PoolParty Suite, etc.) that manage a full life-cycle of the Data Web. More specifically, these solutions are expected to tackle major issues such as the synchronisation problem (monitoring changes), the curation problem (repairing data imperfections), the appraisal problem (assessing the quality of a dataset), the citation problem (how to cite a particular version of a dataset), the archiving problem (retrieving a specific version of a dataset), and the sustainability problem (preserving at scale, ensuring long-term access).

In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of scientific publications around Wikidata. While there are a number of venues for the Wikidata community to exchange, none of those publish original research. We want to bridge the gap between these communities and the research events and give the research-focused part of the Wikidata community a venue to meet and exchange information and knowledge. The Wikidata Workshop 2022 focuses on the challenges and opportunities of working on a collaborative open-domain knowledge graph such as Wikidata, which is edited by an international and multilingual community. We encourage submissions that observe the influence such a knowledge graph has on the web of data, as well as those working on improving this knowledge graph itself.
