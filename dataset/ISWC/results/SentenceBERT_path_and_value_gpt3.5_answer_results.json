The workshop’s aim is thus not just: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, but also 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own “discourse” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions. A recent development in the Semantic Web community is that the general idea of “pattern” has begun to appear in different but related forms, and at WOP 2022, we intend to continue to include these new trends. We plan a full-day workshop consisting of three parts: a keynote, presentations of contributed papers, and a community session discussing joint long-term initiatives, with break-out sessions addressing specific problems.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_7>>webpage>>http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/WOP:2022\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_1>>type>>The 17th International Workshop on Ontology Matching (OM)\n\nQuestion:Who are the organizers of 'The 13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns (WOP)'?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The '13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns (WOP)' is organized by Vojtěch Svátek, Valentina Anita Carriero, María Poveda-Villalón, Christian Kindermann, and Lu Zhou.", "response": "The organizers of 'The 13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns (WOP)' are not mentioned in the given context."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "Who are the chairs of the Poster & Demo Track PC?", "retrieve_results": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_4>>name>>William Van Woensel": 0.16291964054107666, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_50>>name>>Dylan Van Assche": 0.16310536861419678, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_14>>name>>Dan Gruen": 0.16678500175476074, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_25>>name>>Jennifer Sleeman": 0.1675170660018921, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_53>>name>>Nicolas Ferranti": 0.16796398162841797}, "from": "Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Chairs", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.
