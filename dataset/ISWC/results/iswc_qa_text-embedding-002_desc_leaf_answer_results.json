Real-world applications of these technologies combined with machine learning, deep learning, and other AI techniques are particularly interesting. The primary focus should be on the benefits these technologies bring to the intended use case and, if relevant, the added challenges they introduce. It is crucial that the submitted papers provide convincing evidence of the use of the proposed application or tool by the target user group, preferably outside the group that developed it and more broadly, outside of the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph research communities. Additionally, the methodology used for the evaluation should be correct, using both quantitative and/or qualitative metrics to assess the pros and cons of the proposed solution."}, {"query": "What are the review criterion for workshop proposals at ISWC conference?", "output": "The review criteria for workshop proposals at the ISWC conference include:\n\n1. The potential to attract a sufficiently broad community interested in the topic.\n2. A clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application.\n3. Proposals for novel workshops on emerging topics that could become more important to the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Community in future years. Proposers will have to argue why the topic is of increasing importance for the community and why it will attract enough submissions and participants to support the development of the topic.\n4. Mainly, they will be evaluated on the potential for future impact. \n5. For established workshops, reasons for continuing the workshop need to be given. This could include emerging novel topics, external developments prompting new challenges. Relevance and a focused identity versus the main conference should also be argued."}]
