The workshop’s aim is thus not just: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, but also 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own “discourse” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions. A recent development in the Semantic Web community is that the general idea of “pattern” has begun to appear in different but related forms, and at WOP 2022, we intend to continue to include these new trends. We plan a full-day workshop consisting of three parts: a keynote, presentations of contributed papers, and a community session discussing joint long-term initiatives, with break-out sessions addressing specific problems.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_2>>workshops>>workshops_2>>item>>item_4>>url>>http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/WOP:2022\n\nQuestion:Who are the organizers of 'The 13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns (WOP)'?\nAnswer:", "gt": "The '13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns (WOP)' is organized by Vojtěch Svátek, Valentina Anita Carriero, María Poveda-Villalón, Christian Kindermann, and Lu Zhou.", "response": "The organizers of 'The 13th Workshop on Ontology Design and Patterns (WOP)' are not mentioned in the given context."}, {"type": "extraction_atomic", "query": "Who are the chairs of the Poster & Demo Track PC?", "retrieve_results": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_21>>name>>Pouya Ghiasnezhad Omran": 0.16551560163497925, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_4>>affiliation>>University of Dalhousie": 0.16724729537963867, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_29>>affiliation>>Fondazione Bruno Kessler - FBK-IRST": 0.16892164945602417, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_54>>affiliation>>Universidad Politécnica de Madrid": 0.17023730278015137, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Organization>>Doctoral Consortium PC>>Program Committee Members>>Program Committee Members_21>>affiliation>>Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, NL": 0.17381685972213745}, "from": "Menu>>Organization>>Poster & Demo Track PC>>Chairs", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

While there are a number of venues for the Wikidata community to exchange, none of those publish original research. We want to bridge the gap between these communities and the research events and give the research-focused part of the Wikidata community a venue to meet and exchange information and knowledge. The Wikidata Workshop 2022 focuses on the challenges and opportunities of working on a collaborative open-domain knowledge graph such as Wikidata, which is edited by an international and multilingual community. We encourage submissions that observe the influence such a knowledge graph has on the web of data, as well as those working on improving this knowledge graph itself.
