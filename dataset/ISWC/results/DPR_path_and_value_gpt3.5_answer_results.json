In addition Covid 19 is the most measured event in history and oceans of big data have been generated during this event. Since the turn of the millennium we have been experiencing several other challenges which concern our closed system and affect our health, for instance the climate(https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/health-as-the-central-driver-for-action-on-climate-change) and food(https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nzd5fca3) crises. For example, we are aware of the devastating effect of rising temperatures on the health of our oceans, on the loss of biodiversity and on the migration of humans and animals. We are also well aware that the planet’s demographics will require more food to feed a world population expected to reach 9.7bn by 2050(https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html) and at the same time we have committed to diminishing greenhouse gas emissions to reduce pollution and CO2 footprint. Following the conceptual blueprint of Circular Economy(https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview#:~:text=A%20circular%20economy%20decouples%20economic,loss%2C%20waste%2C%20and%20pollution.) and Circular Agriculture(https://www.wur.nl/en/show/circular-agriculture-a-new-perspective-for-dutch-agriculture-1.htm), this  could be the right time to expand our approach to health to a circular model which encompasses the intricate and novel links between human health and the health of this closed system. This circular approach would be data driven and could be implemented by using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) roadmap as an accelerator of convergence for health. All the 17 goals have ties to the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment, and it would seem reasonable to prioritize certain activities and capitalize on existing guidelines and commitments. The novelty of the Circular Health approach is to use post-Covid-19 renewed health priorities to promote the convergence of health-related issues which can be achieved within the Sustainable Development Goals framework. In this way it will be possible to advance urgent health priorities within an existing framework which aims at sustainability and at advancing health as an essential resource within a closed system, which needs to be regenerated and addressed in its complexity.": 0.1890045404434204, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Tutorials>>Tutorials_5>>abstract>>In the last few years, there has been a lot of research in applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to Earth observation data. The subareas of Artificial Intelligence that contributed the most to the science of satellite data. are Deep Learning and Semantic Technologies (Ontologies and Linked Data). This tutorial will survey the latest state of the art in this area. It will start by explaining what satellite data is and why satellite data is a paradigmatic case of big spatiotemporal data amenable to Artificial Intelligence techniques. Examples of big satellite data, information and knowledge will be given for the case of the Copernicus program of the European Union. We will teach the tutorial participants how to “break satellite data silos open” by publishing the metadata of satellite datasets as microformats to enable their discovery by modern search engines through services like Dataset Search of Google, how to extract important geospatial information from satellite datasets using deep learning technologies, how to interlink this information with other relevant information available on the Web, and how to make this wealth of data and information freely available on the Web to enable the easy development of geospatial applications. We will present a complete pipeline that starts with satellite datasets in various formats that are made freely available in the archives of space agencies and ends with the deployment of an interactive visual application that uses satellite data utilizing linked data technologies. We will also present a query answering system over geospatial knowledge graphs, that allows non-experts to access linked geospatial data using natural language. The tutorial will give an in-depth coverage of the relevant techniques, systems and some applications developed by the presenters in the last 12 years in the context of 1 ERC grant (BigEarth), 12 European projects (TELEIOS, LEO, Melodies, Optique, BigDataEurope, Copernicus App Lab, WDAQUA, ExtremeEarth, AI4Copernicus and DeepCube), 1 ESA project (Prod-Trees), 3 projects funded by the German government (BIFOLD, TreeSatAI, IDEAL-VGI) and 2 projects funded by the Greek government (SCARE and GeoQA).

Since the turn of the millennium we have been experiencing several other challenges which concern our closed system and affect our health, for instance the climate(https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/health-as-the-central-driver-for-action-on-climate-change) and food(https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nzd5fca3) crises. For example, we are aware of the devastating effect of rising temperatures on the health of our oceans, on the loss of biodiversity and on the migration of humans and animals. We are also well aware that the planet’s demographics will require more food to feed a world population expected to reach 9.7bn by 2050(https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html) and at the same time we have committed to diminishing greenhouse gas emissions to reduce pollution and CO2 footprint. Following the conceptual blueprint of Circular Economy(https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview#:~:text=A%20circular%20economy%20decouples%20economic,loss%2C%20waste%2C%20and%20pollution.) and Circular Agriculture(https://www.wur.nl/en/show/circular-agriculture-a-new-perspective-for-dutch-agriculture-1.htm), this  could be the right time to expand our approach to health to a circular model which encompasses the intricate and novel links between human health and the health of this closed system. This circular approach would be data driven and could be implemented by using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) roadmap as an accelerator of convergence for health. All the 17 goals have ties to the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment, and it would seem reasonable to prioritize certain activities and capitalize on existing guidelines and commitments. The novelty of the Circular Health approach is to use post-Covid-19 renewed health priorities to promote the convergence of health-related issues which can be achieved within the Sustainable Development Goals framework. In this way it will be possible to advance urgent health priorities within an existing framework which aims at sustainability and at advancing health as an essential resource within a closed system, which needs to be regenerated and addressed in its complexity.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Tutorials>>Tutorials_5>>abstract>>In the last few years, there has been a lot of research in applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to Earth observation data. The subareas of Artificial Intelligence that contributed the most to the science of satellite data. are Deep Learning and Semantic Technologies (Ontologies and Linked Data). This tutorial will survey the latest state of the art in this area. It will start by explaining what satellite data is and why satellite data is a paradigmatic case of big spatiotemporal data amenable to Artificial Intelligence techniques. Examples of big satellite data, information and knowledge will be given for the case of the Copernicus program of the European Union. We will teach the tutorial participants how to “break satellite data silos open” by publishing the metadata of satellite datasets as microformats to enable their discovery by modern search engines through services like Dataset Search of Google, how to extract important geospatial information from satellite datasets using deep learning technologies, how to interlink this information with other relevant information available on the Web, and how to make this wealth of data and information freely available on the Web to enable the easy development of geospatial applications. We will present a complete pipeline that starts with satellite datasets in various formats that are made freely available in the archives of space agencies and ends with the deployment of an interactive visual application that uses satellite data utilizing linked data technologies. We will also present a query answering system over geospatial knowledge graphs, that allows non-experts to access linked geospatial data using natural language. The tutorial will give an in-depth coverage of the relevant techniques, systems and some applications developed by the presenters in the last 12 years in the context of 1 ERC grant (BigEarth), 12 European projects (TELEIOS, LEO, Melodies, Optique, BigDataEurope, Copernicus App Lab, WDAQUA, ExtremeEarth, AI4Copernicus and DeepCube), 1 ESA project (Prod-Trees), 3 projects funded by the German government (BIFOLD, TreeSatAI, IDEAL-VGI) and 2 projects funded by the Greek government (SCARE and GeoQA). The two teams presenting the tutorial (from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Technische Universität Berlin) come from different disciplines (Computer Science and Satellite Remote Sensing) and will offer an interdisciplinary presentation of the relevant theoretical and practical issues.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Calls>>Call For In-Use Track Papers>>Call For In-Use Track Papers_1>>Exemplary In-Use Papers From Previous Editions of ISWC>>Exemplary In-Use Papers From Previous Editions of ISWC_3>>Thanapalasingam T., Osborne F., Birukou A., Motta E.

Inspired by very different backgrounds – Web data exchange and mathematical logic – the two worlds have sometimes be perceived as complementary, even conflicting. But the general trend towards knowledge graphs made such discussions irrelevant, and modern knowledge models, such as Wikidata, often combine instance and schema data side by side. In my invited talk, I will explain how this unification of data and ontology may present an opportunity to the Semantic Web, and discuss how recent results in rule-based reasoning may provide a basis for overcoming related challenges. This involves some interesting insights about the expressive power that is conferred by extending rules with value invention – the ability to create fresh blank nodes. Besides the theoretical effects of this addition, we can also demonstrate concrete practical uses of this expressive power.": 0.12305182218551636, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_8>>abstract>>There is a growing interest in generating summaries from the facts contained in a Knowledge Graph. Condensing relevant information into a few statistic data, sentences, paragraphs, or triplets is an emerging problem that remains to be solved as knowledge graphs increase complexity and expand in size and domains. Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum) aims at producing concise but informative descriptions of the content of a knowledge graph that help users to efficiently access and distill valuable information from it. Conversational systems, question-answering services or any other method leveraging the narrative content around the entities in a knowledge graph will benefit from these techniques.": 0.1233893632888794, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Tutorials>>Tutorials_2>>abstract>>The explosion of the data on the semantic web has led to many weakly structured, and irregular data sources, becoming available every day. The schema of these sources is useful for a number of tasks, such as source selection, query answering, exploration and summariza- tion. However, although semantic web data might contain schema in- formation, in many cases this is completely missing or partially defined. Schema discovery consists in extracting schema-related information from the original semantic graph, which some applications can exploit instead of or along with the original graph, to perform some tasks more efficiently. This tutorial presents a structured analysis and comparison of existing works in the area of semantic schema discovery helping researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges in the area; it is based upon a recent survey we authored.": 0.13318318128585815, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Doctoral Consortium>>table>>table_4>>agenda item>>PAPER SESSION 1\nMentors: Oktie Hassanzadeh, Ernesto Jimenez-ruiz, Mdkamruzzaman Sarker\n1.

Inspired by very different backgrounds – Web data exchange and mathematical logic – the two worlds have sometimes be perceived as complementary, even conflicting. But the general trend towards knowledge graphs made such discussions irrelevant, and modern knowledge models, such as Wikidata, often combine instance and schema data side by side. In my invited talk, I will explain how this unification of data and ontology may present an opportunity to the Semantic Web, and discuss how recent results in rule-based reasoning may provide a basis for overcoming related challenges. This involves some interesting insights about the expressive power that is conferred by extending rules with value invention – the ability to create fresh blank nodes. Besides the theoretical effects of this addition, we can also demonstrate concrete practical uses of this expressive power.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Workshops>>Workshops_8>>abstract>>There is a growing interest in generating summaries from the facts contained in a Knowledge Graph. Condensing relevant information into a few statistic data, sentences, paragraphs, or triplets is an emerging problem that remains to be solved as knowledge graphs increase complexity and expand in size and domains. Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum) aims at producing concise but informative descriptions of the content of a knowledge graph that help users to efficiently access and distill valuable information from it. Conversational systems, question-answering services or any other method leveraging the narrative content around the entities in a knowledge graph will benefit from these techniques.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Tutorials>>Tutorials_2>>abstract>>The explosion of the data on the semantic web has led to many weakly structured, and irregular data sources, becoming available every day. The schema of these sources is useful for a number of tasks, such as source selection, query answering, exploration and summariza- tion. However, although semantic web data might contain schema in- formation, in many cases this is completely missing or partially defined. Schema discovery consists in extracting schema-related information from the original semantic graph, which some applications can exploit instead of or along with the original graph, to perform some tasks more efficiently. This tutorial presents a structured analysis and comparison of existing works in the area of semantic schema discovery helping researchers and practitioners to understand the challenges in the area; it is based upon a recent survey we authored.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Doctoral Consortium>>table>>table_4>>agenda item>>PAPER SESSION 1\nMentors: Oktie Hassanzadeh, Ernesto Jimenez-ruiz, Mdkamruzzaman Sarker\n1.

Springer requires the sources of articles that have been accepted for publication in LaTeX or Word format(http://www.springer.com/de/it-informatik/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). If an article submitted in HTML is accepted, the authors can choose to do this step manually or using tool support as outlined below.\nArticles accepted in the Posters & Demos track and in the Doctoral Consortium will be published as CEUR-WS.org proceedings volumes. CEUR-WS.org(http://ceur-ws.org/) allows articles to be in HTML but, for guaranteed printability and archiving, requires an additional PDF, which should be a print-out of the HTML article in the LNCS layout.\nArticles accepted in the Industry track will be published on the conference website.

(revised 21 April 2021). The authors may self-archive and make available an author-created version of their own contribution on their own website and/or on their employer’s website, including their final version (as submitted to the conference or workshop after the reviewing process). The author may archive and make available the same on non-commercial archival repositories like ArXiv/CoRR, HAL, etc. The author may state explicitly that, content-wise, such a version is the final one; however, they may not use the publisher’s version of the paper as published in the printed and electronic proceedings. The author’s archiving and self-archiving rights start immediately upon completion of the work. The author of an individual contribution retains the right to use their contribution for their further scientific career by including the final published paper in their dissertation or doctoral thesis, provided acknowledgement is given to the original source of publication. The authors also retain the right to use, without having to ask, parts of the contribution (e.g., figures, tables, paragraphs, etc.) for inclusion in future work, and to publish a substantially revised version (at least 30% new content) presenting new content elsewhere, provided that the original contribution is cited properly.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Calls>>Call For Resources Track Papers>>Call For Resources Track Papers_1>>Submission Details>>Submission Details_8>>Accepted papers will be distributed to conference attendees and also published by Springer in the conference proceedings, as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.\n\nQuestion:Who is the publisher of the full conference proceedings?\nAnswer:", "gt": "Springer is the publisher of the full conference proceedings.", "response": "The publisher of the full conference proceedings is Springer."}, {"type": "reasoning_atomic", "query": "What is the required password for the ISWC 2022 conference Zoom link?", "retrieve_results": {"ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_1>>tutorials>>tutorials_2>>item>>item_1>>url>>https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/events/iswc-2022-a-beginners-guide-to-reasoning-how-to-reason-your-way-to-better-data": 0.11400163173675537, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_2>>tutorials>>tutorials_1>>item>>item_2>>url>>https://kl4ad.github.io/2022/": 0.11739331483840942, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_3>>table>>table_9>>content>>SEMANTIC WEB CHALLENGE 1(II)": 0.11983639001846313, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_1>>tutorials>>tutorials_2>>item>>item_2>>title>>Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Earth Observation Data (AI4EO)": 0.1205906867980957, "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Table>>Table_4>>table>>table_14>>item>>item_3>>title>>Strabo 2: Distributed Management of Massive Geospatial RDF Datasets Research": 0.12101328372955322}, "from": "ISWC2023>>Menu>>Program>>Conference>>Final ISWC 2022 Program>>Zoom Guide", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question.

There are several approaches and frameworks (Linked Data Stack, PoolParty Suite, etc.) that manage a full life-cycle of the Data Web. More specifically, these solutions are expected to tackle major issues such as the synchronisation problem (monitoring changes), the curation problem (repairing data imperfections), the appraisal problem (assessing the quality of a dataset), the citation problem (how to cite a particular version of a dataset), the archiving problem (retrieving a specific version of a dataset), and the sustainability problem (preserving at scale, ensuring long-term access).

This tutorial will survey the latest state of the art in this area. It will start by explaining what satellite data is and why satellite data is a paradigmatic case of big spatiotemporal data amenable to Artificial Intelligence techniques. Examples of big satellite data, information and knowledge will be given for the case of the Copernicus program of the European Union. We will teach the tutorial participants how to “break satellite data silos open” by publishing the metadata of satellite datasets as microformats to enable their discovery by modern search engines through services like Dataset Search of Google, how to extract important geospatial information from satellite datasets using deep learning technologies, how to interlink this information with other relevant information available on the Web, and how to make this wealth of data and information freely available on the Web to enable the easy development of geospatial applications. We will present a complete pipeline that starts with satellite datasets in various formats that are made freely available in the archives of space agencies and ends with the deployment of an interactive visual application that uses satellite data utilizing linked data technologies.
