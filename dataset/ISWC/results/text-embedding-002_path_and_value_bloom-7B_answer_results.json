Demos will be performed through screen sharing. A physical poster is only required for presenters of posters or demos who intend to attend the conference in person. For the final “camera-ready” version of accepted posters or demos, authors are required to submit (1) the camera-ready form of the extended abstract; and (2) a 1-minute “teaser” video briefly describing the work.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Calls>>Call For Posters and Demos>>Call For Posters and Demos_1>>Review Criteria>>Review Criteria_1>>Submissions must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ISWC 2022. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, topicality, and clarity. All submissions to the Posters & Demos Track will be reviewed by at least three program committee members, including those related to already accepted full papers. The purpose of the track is to allow the presentation of preliminary results to the community, provided that originality and significance of the contribution are ensured. Authors submitting a demonstration are strongly encouraged to include in the paper a pointer to an online demo or video of the application to be presented. The absence of a pointer will affect the overall evaluation of the submission.\n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Calls>>Call For Posters and Demos>>Call For Posters and Demos_1>>Topics of Interest>>Topics of Interest_2>>Demonstrations are intended to showcase innovative Semantic Web related implementations and technologies, arising both from academia and industry. \n\nISWC2023>>Menu>>Calls>>Call For Posters and Demos>>Call For Posters and Demos_1>>description>>description_2>>The informal setting of the Posters and Demos Track encourages presenters and participants to engage in discussions about the work.
