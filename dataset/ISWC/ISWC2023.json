We welcome work that relates to the W3C Semantic Web recommendations (e.g., RDF, OWL, SPARQL, SHACL, etc.) that may also lie at the intersection of the Semantic Web and other scientific disciplines. Submissions to the research track should describe original, significant, and replicable research on the Semantic Web. ",

Resources include, but not restricted to: datasets, ontologies/vocabularies, ontology design patterns, evaluation benchmarks or methods, software tools/services, APIs and software frameworks, workflows, crowdsourcing task designs, protocols, methodologies and metrics, that have contributed or may contribute to the generation of novel scientific work. In particular, we encourage the sharing of such resources following best and well-established practices within the Semantic Web community. As such, this track calls for contributions that provide a concise and clear description of a resource and its usage."

                    "submission format": "Submissions must be in PDF, formatted in the style of the Springer Publications format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). For details on the LNCS style, see Springer’s Author Instructions(https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines?countryChanged=true).",
                    "details": "Each author will either be expected to sign the LNCS copyright form or select the optional Open Access option which goes with the CC-BY4.0 license (see http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings for the details) and costs €38 per page (e.g., €570 for a paper of 15 pages) with the fee being charged on top of the conference fee. (revised 21 April 2021). The authors may self-archive and make available an author-created version of their own contribution on their own website and/or on their employer’s website, including their final version (as submitted to the conference or workshop after the reviewing process). The author may archive and make available the same on non-commercial archival repositories like ArXiv/CoRR, HAL, etc. The author may state explicitly that, content-wise, such a version is the final one; however, they may not use the publisher’s version of the paper as published in the printed and electronic proceedings. The author’s archiving and self-archiving rights start immediately upon completion of the work. The author of an individual contribution retains the right to use their contribution for their further scientific career by including the final published paper in their dissertation or doctoral thesis, provided acknowledgement is given to the original source of publication. The authors also retain the right to use, without having to ask, parts of the contribution (e.g., figures, tables, paragraphs, etc.) for inclusion in future work, and to publish a substantially revised version (at least 30% new content) presenting new content elsewhere, provided that the original contribution is cited properly.",

                    "description": "ISWC 2022 welcomes research articles employing the Open Web Platform. This document provides guidance to authors who wish to make their contributions available in HTML and related technology stack.",
                    "General Guidance": "Contributions in HTML should be shared in EasyChair as a ZIP archive that contains the complete and self-contained content of the article. It should include a main “index.html” and all used resources (like media, scripts) to guarantee a correct visualization of the document on common desktop and mobile Web browsers. Please note the following key requirements:\nHTML template: any tooling or process can be used to produce the HTML.\nContent: the full content of the article must be human-readable with HTML alone. The use of CSS and JavaScript is encouraged, but should not interfere with the accessibility of the content.\nOffline-friendly: there must not be any external dependencies (e.g., a network connection) to retrieve, to render, or to manipulate the content of the article.\nPrivacy: scripts must not be used to identify or track readers.\nView: the rendered article (HTML+CSS) should have the “look and feel” of the LNCS authoring guidelines. Pixel-perfection is not expected. This is to ensure visual consistency of the proceedings as well as to have comparative page limits with the print-based publication. The HTML article has to be compliant with the page limit constraint.\n It should be possible to read the HTML contributions on an average desktop computer or mobile computer that is equipped with a reasonably current, Javascript-enabled Web browser (e.g., Firefox, Chrome/Chromium, Internet Explorer, Brave, Safari). We encourage authors to make their articles as accessible as possible (for reading and interacting) because different consumers (in this case initially the reviewers and chairs) may have different environments and abilities.",
                    "Final (“camera-ready”) version": "Formatting requirements for the final version differ by call.\nArticles accepted in the Research, In-Use, and Resources tracks will be published by Springer in the printed conference proceedings, as a part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Springer requires the sources of articles that have been accepted for publication in LaTeX or Word format(http://www.springer.com/de/it-informatik/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). If an article submitted in HTML is accepted, the authors can choose to do this step manually or using tool support as outlined below.\nArticles accepted in the Posters & Demos track and in the Doctoral Consortium will be published as CEUR-WS.org proceedings volumes. CEUR-WS.org(http://ceur-ws.org/) allows articles to be in HTML but, for guaranteed printability and archiving, requires an additional PDF, which should be a print-out of the HTML article in the LNCS layout.\nArticles accepted in the Industry track will be published on the conference website. The same “HTML+PDF” rule applies as explained above for posters, demos and doctoral papers.",
                    "Recommendations": "We recommend that authors take the following steps independently of the general process:\nBefore sharing your article with ISWC, self-publish your HTML version, eg. at a repository, personal or institution website that’s publicly accessible and archivable from a URL.\nInclude the URL of your self-published article along the lines of: “Identifier: http://example.org/article “ after the list of authors and/or include the URL in the abstract of your article.\nMake sure to preserve this information in your camera-ready version.\nConsider using a Creative Commons(https://creativecommons.org/) license like CC BY 4.0(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) on the self-published version.\nCreate multiple archived copies of the self-published version using on-demand free archive services like archive.org, archive.is(https://web.archive.org/).\nIf you intend to also publish the “Author’s Accepted Manuscript” version following peer-review, note Springer’s self-archiving policy(https://www.springer.com/gb/open-access/authors-rights/self-archiving-policy/2124).\nSend a notification about your original self-published article to the Linked Open Research Cloud (LORC, https://linkedresearch.org/) to improve the discoverability of your article.\nFor additional help, authors are welcome to join the public chat(https://gitter.im/linkedresearch/chat) on Linked Research(https://linkedresearch.org/). Please note that this not an official communication channel of the conference. It is an open community for scholarly communication and people passionate about the Web.\nAuthors are encouraged to use tooling and processes that work best for them.",
                    "dokieli": "dokieli(https://dokie.li/) is a client-side editor for decentralized article publishing in HTML+RDF annotations, notifications, and social interactions. It implements W3C Recommendations like Web Annotation(https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/), Linked Data Notifications(https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/), and ActivityPub(https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).\nThe LNCS author guidelines(https://dokie.li/lncs-splnproc) can be used as template (ZIP package as expected for the submission(https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/files/2018/12/dokieli-authoring-1xkaust.zip)). There is a list of examples in the wild(https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/wiki#examples-in-the-wild).\nAuthors that would like to self-publish can use any HTTP server. Authors, reviewers, and readers can use their own WebID(https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/) and Linked Data based personal storages, eg. Solid(http://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/), with dokieli. Join the chat(https://gitter.im/linkeddata/dokieli) if you need help.",
                    "ScholarMarkdown": "ScholarMarkdown(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown) is framework for writing articles in the lightweight Markdown syntax, with automatic translation into HTML+RDFa, and the option to output PDF(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/PDF-Compilation). It provides syntactic sugar to easily perform common tasks such as citing articles(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Snippets#citations), writing math equations(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Snippets#math-equations), and more(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Snippets). Note: ScholarMarkdown requires Ruby(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to be installed.\nThe Markdown-based source files enables straightforward versioning and collaborative editing with version-control systems such as git, and integrates nicely with automated self-publishing via solutions such as GitHub pages(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Self-publishing), as demonstrated by the examples in the wild(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki/Examples).\nTo get started, follow the quick start guide(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown#quick-start), which will provide you with the the required LNCS template in Markdown (Example of the initial template(https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/files/2018/12/scholarmarkdown-template-initial-1ukmyy2.zip)). After compiling your Markdown files to HTML(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown#3-compile-your-article), an output/ directory will be created (Example of the compiled template(https://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/files/2018/12/scholarmarkdown-template-compiled-10hkhxq.zip)). This output/folder contains a standalone version of your article in HTML, and this is the folder that must be submitted on EasyChair. Further details on ScholarMarkdown can be found on the wiki(https://github.com/rubensworks/ScholarMarkdown/wiki).

Supported by AI, we will be able to make more grounded decisions and to focus on the main values and goals of a decision process rather than on routine and repetitive tasks. However, such a powerful technology also raises some concerns, related for example to the black-box nature of some AI approaches, the possible discriminatory decisions that AI algorithms may recommend, and the accountability and responsibility when an AI system is involved in an undesirable outcome. Also, since many successful AI techniques rely on huge amounts of data, it is important to know how data are handled by AI systems and by those who produce them. These concerns are among the obstacles that hold AI back or that cause worry for current AI users, adopters, and policy makers. Without answers to these questions, many will not trust AI, and therefore will not fully adopt it nor get its positive impact. In this talk I will present the main issues around AI ethics, some of the proposed technical and non-technical solutions, as well as practical actions and regulations being defined for AI development, deployment, and use. I will also highlight the relevance of some AI ethics issues to the semantic web."

But Covid-19 has done much more than this. It has exposed us to another type of vulnerability – the vulnerability of the systems we operate in. It has also opened our eyes to the harsh reality that we live in a closed system, in which we are entirely interconnected and interdependent with other creatures on planet earth. This awareness has paved the way to acknowledge that as a society we should embrace the One Health(https://www.who.int/news/item/01-12-2021-tripartite-and-unep-support-ohhlep-s-definition-of-one-health) approach which recognizes the links between the health of humans, animals, and the environment. Covid 19 has also shown us that such a major health crisis has multiple drivers and ramifications that include social(https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/addressing-the-hidden-pandemic-the-impact-of-the-covid-19-crisis-on-mental-health-f02d8e3e-6252-4f4e-91f5-476ad2c9a027), economic(https://www.brookings.edu/research/social-and-economic-impact-of-covid-19/), and digital(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10070-w) drivers that have caused the pandemic to unravel in the way it did. In addition Covid 19 is the most measured event in history and oceans of big data have been generated during this event. Since the turn of the millennium we have been experiencing several other challenges which concern our closed system and affect our health, for instance the climate(https://www.oecd-forum.org/posts/health-as-the-central-driver-for-action-on-climate-change) and food(https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1n/k1nzd5fca3) crises. For example, we are aware of the devastating effect of rising temperatures on the health of our oceans, on the loss of biodiversity and on the migration of humans and animals. We are also well aware that the planet’s demographics will require more food to feed a world population expected to reach 9.7bn by 2050(https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html) and at the same time we have committed to diminishing greenhouse gas emissions to reduce pollution and CO2 footprint. Following the conceptual blueprint of Circular Economy(https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview#:~:text=A%20circular%20economy%20decouples%20economic,loss%2C%20waste%2C%20and%20pollution.) and Circular Agriculture(https://www.wur.nl/en/show/circular-agriculture-a-new-perspective-for-dutch-agriculture-1.htm), this  could be the right time to expand our approach to health to a circular model which encompasses the intricate and novel links between human health and the health of this closed system. This circular approach would be data driven and could be implemented by using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) roadmap as an accelerator of convergence for health. All the 17 goals have ties to the health of humans, animals, plants, and the environment, and it would seem reasonable to prioritize certain activities and capitalize on existing guidelines and commitments. The novelty of the Circular Health approach is to use post-Covid-19 renewed health priorities to promote the convergence of health-related issues which can be achieved within the Sustainable Development Goals framework. In this way it will be possible to advance urgent health priorities within an existing framework which aims at sustainability and at advancing health as an essential resource within a closed system, which needs to be regenerated and addressed in its complexity."

Inspired by very different backgrounds – Web data exchange and mathematical logic – the two worlds have sometimes be perceived as complementary, even conflicting. But the general trend towards knowledge graphs made such discussions irrelevant, and modern knowledge models, such as Wikidata, often combine instance and schema data side by side. In my invited talk, I will explain how this unification of data and ontology may present an opportunity to the Semantic Web, and discuss how recent results in rule-based reasoning may provide a basis for overcoming related challenges. This involves some interesting insights about the expressive power that is conferred by extending rules with value invention – the ability to create fresh blank nodes. Besides the theoretical effects of this addition, we can also demonstrate concrete practical uses of this expressive power."

Although several works have explored this ability in a setting called probing or prompting, the viability of knowledge base construction from LMs has not yet been explored. In this challenge, participants are asked to build actual knowledge bases from LMs, for given subjects and relations. In crucial difference to existing probing benchmarks like LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019), we make no simplifying assumptions on relation cardinalities, i.e., a subject-entity can stand in relation with zero, one, or many object-entities. Furthermore, submissions need to go beyond just ranking the predictions, and materialize outputs, which are evaluated by established KB metrics of precision and recall. The challenge comes with two tracks: (i) a BERT-type LM track with low computational requirements, and (ii) an open track, where participants can use any LM of their choice.",

As an alternative, neuro-symbolic approaches are gaining significant attention. However, the existing methods can not deal with very expressive ontology languages. Other than that, some SPARQL query engines also support reasoning, but their performance also is still limited. To find and improve these performance bottlenecks of the reasons, we ideally need several real-world ontologies that span the broad spectrum in terms of their size and expressivity. However, that is often not the case. One of the potential reasons for the ontology developers to not build ontologies that vary in terms of size and expressivity is the performance bottleneck of the reasons. SemREC aims to deal with this chicken and egg problem. The second edition of this challenge includes the following tasks. Task-1. Ontologies. Submit a real-world ontology that is a challenge in terms of the reasoning time or memory consumed during reasoning. Task-2. Systems. Submit an ontology/RDFS reasoner that uses neural-symbolic techniques or SPARQL query engines that support reasoning.",

It will start by explaining what satellite data is and why satellite data is a paradigmatic case of big spatiotemporal data amenable to Artificial Intelligence techniques. Examples of big satellite data, information and knowledge will be given for the case of the Copernicus program of the European Union. We will teach the tutorial participants how to “break satellite data silos open” by publishing the metadata of satellite datasets as microformats to enable their discovery by modern search engines through services like Dataset Search of Google, how to extract important geospatial information from satellite datasets using deep learning technologies, how to interlink this information with other relevant information available on the Web, and how to make this wealth of data and information freely available on the Web to enable the easy development of geospatial applications. We will present a complete pipeline that starts with satellite datasets in various formats that are made freely available in the archives of space agencies and ends with the deployment of an interactive visual application that uses satellite data utilizing linked data technologies. We will also present a query answering system over geospatial knowledge graphs, that allows non-experts to access linked geospatial data using natural language. The tutorial will give an in-depth coverage of the relevant techniques, systems and some applications developed by the presenters in the last 12 years in the context of 1 ERC grant (BigEarth), 12 European projects (TELEIOS, LEO, Melodies, Optique, BigDataEurope, Copernicus App Lab, WDAQUA, ExtremeEarth, AI4Copernicus and DeepCube), 1 ESA project (Prod-Trees), 3 projects funded by the German government (BIFOLD, TreeSatAI, IDEAL-VGI) and 2 projects funded by the Greek government (SCARE and GeoQA).

Wikidata acts as the central source of common, open structured data used by Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikisource, and others. It is used in a variety of academic and industrial applications. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of scientific publications around Wikidata. While there are a number of venues for the Wikidata community to exchange, none of those publish original research. We want to bridge the gap between these communities and the research events and give the research-focused part of the Wikidata community a venue to meet and exchange information and knowledge. The Wikidata Workshop 2022 focuses on the challenges and opportunities of working on a collaborative open-domain knowledge graph such as Wikidata, which is edited by an international and multilingual community. We encourage submissions that observe the influence such a knowledge graph has on the web of data, as well as those working on improving this knowledge graph itself. This workshop brings together everyone working around Wikidata in both the scientific field and industry to discuss trends and topics around this collaborative knowledge graph.",

Therefore, it is important for a government to offer services that make legal information easily accessible to the citizens, enabling them to defend their rights, auditing public procurement, or to use legislation as part of their job. It is equally important to have professionals (lawyers, judges, administrations, etc.) access legislation in ways that allow them to do their job easily (e.g., they might need to be able to see the evolution of a law over time). Despite recent efforts to make all this accessible and transparent to both citizens and the companies involved, the level of implementation in different countries and layers of public administration still makes access difficult. For this reason, in the age of the Web it is important to develop applications for citizens and professionals easily, by connecting the available legal information with other kinds of government or private sector information. The vision of the AI4LEGAL workshop is to bring together Artificial Intelligence and practitioners to discuss the digitization of legal documents, such as legislation and public procurement data, in today’s interconnected world.",

The size and complexity of ontologies and Linked Data in the Semantic Web constantly grows and the diverse backgrounds of the users and application areas multiply at the same time. Providing users with visual representations and sophisticated interaction techniques can significantly aid the exploration and under-standing of the domains and knowledge represented by ontologies and Linked Data. There is no one-size-fits-all solution but different use cases demand different visualization and interaction techniques. Ultimately, providing better user interfaces, visual representations and interaction techniques will foster user engagement and likely lead to higher quality results in different applications employing ontologies and proliferate the consumption of Linked Data.",

Open Data plays a catalyst role in the way structured information is exploited on a large scale. A traditional view of digitally preserving these datasets by “pickling and locking them away” for future use, like groceries, conflicts with their evolution. There are several approaches and frameworks (Linked Data Stack, PoolParty Suite, etc.) that manage a full life-cycle of the Data Web. More specifically, these solutions are expected to tackle major issues such as the synchronisation problem (monitoring changes), the curation problem (repairing data imperfections), the appraisal problem (assessing the quality of a dataset), the citation problem (how to cite a particular version of a dataset), the archiving problem (retrieving a specific version of a dataset), and the sustainability problem (preserving at scale, ensuring long-term access). During the past seven years, the MEPDaW workshop series has been gathering researchers from the community around these challenges. So far the series successfully published more than 50 research efforts allowing more than 60 individual authors to present and share their ideas.",

In order to pursue more advanced methodologies, it has become critical that the communities related to Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and NLP join their forces in order to develop more effective algorithms and applications.

The increased attention to ODPs in recent years through their interaction with emerging trends of Semantic Web such as knowledge graphs can be attributed to their benefit for knowledge engineers and Semantic Web developers. Such benefits come in the form of direct links to requirements, reuse, guidance, and better communication. The workshop’s aim is thus not just: 1) providing an arena for discussing patterns, pattern-based ontologies, systems, datasets, but also 2) broadening the pattern community by developing its own “discourse” for discussing and describing relevant problems and their solutions. A recent development in the Semantic Web community is that the general idea of “pattern” has begun to appear in different but related forms, and at WOP 2022, we intend to continue to include these new trends. We plan a full-day workshop consisting of three parts: a keynote, presentations of contributed papers, and a community session discussing joint long-term initiatives, with break-out sessions addressing specific problems.",
